This course is an introduction into the various ways in which race and capitalism, our dominant economic system, have shaped the history of American cities. It asks, how has the production of racial difference enabled the production of wealth? And, subsequently how have cities become the products of this dynamic process? Through interdisciplinary methods that bring together american studies, architecture, history, sociology, political science, and geography, this course explores how the political economies of American cities are interwoven with race. The first two weeks of the course explore the foundations of race and capitalism in metropolitan spaces by grounding students in the theory of race and capital. The last three weeks will ground students in the historical processes that diverse cities have experienced in relation to race and capital including industrialization and deindustrialization, public policy as related to employment and housing, and private efforts by actors across the color line who sought sustenance and\/or wealth. In addition to a midterm. Students will engage in a field project as a final assignment that will serve as the culmination of the session\u2019s focus by enabling students to apply, test, and refine their findings.","requirements":"None","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"Cancelled","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":4,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":[],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"AMST","number":"S250","section":"1","row_id":3}],"oci_ids":["30237"],"row_id":3},{"course_name_id":"78880","subject":"AMST","number":"S251","section":"1","oci_id":"30266","title":"Asian American Popular Culture","long_title":"Asian American Popular Culture","description":"What\/where is Asian American popular culture?

This course follows up with the question: how do musicals discursively and materially construct the United States? That is, on the one hand, what can we learn from the plots of these musicals, filled with state building, tales of diaspora, and interracial love stories? And on the other hand, what can we learn from the means of their production: how to find 150 Asian-American extras in LA, how to match the perfect face with the perfect voice, and how to turn Margarita Cansino into All-American bombshell Rita Hayworth? These approaches intersect and are in conversation; however, each calls upon the strength of a different field. In this course we will challenge our students to interrogate these familiar films, to dwell in the trouble of mass culture\u2019s repressions, appropriations, and utopian imaginaries, but also to figure why it is so easy to mindlessly hum those tunes. \u00a0","requirements":"none","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"https:\/\/yale.instructure.com\/courses\/38148\/assignments\/syllabus","course_home_url":"","row":7,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Leana Hirschfeld-Kroen","Randa Tawil"],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"TTh 13.00-16.15","long_summary":"TTh 13.00-16.15","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["13","16.15",""]],"Thursday":[["13","16.15",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"AMST","number":"S311","section":"1","row_id":6}],"oci_ids":["30292"],"row_id":6},{"course_name_id":"78883","subject":"AMST","number":"S312","section":"1","oci_id":"30257","title":"CANCELLED","long_title":"American Public Sculpture","description":"Cancelled.

New urban renewal policies have called for the demolition of public housing complexes, once again displacing various racial and ethnic communities under the guise of mixed-income communities.

concepts of race, class, gender, and citizenship.\u00a0 Attentive to the concerns of this new voting block as well as to those of the movements for social justice it denigrates, we delve into the apparatuses of neoliberal capitalism itself, tracking its affective economies, global entanglements, and myriad modes of commodification.\u00a0 We ask, throughout, whether the fantasy of democracy has run its course or is more vital now than ever before.\u00a0\u00a0","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"Cancelled","syllabus_url":"https:\/\/yale.instructure.com\/courses\/38144\/assignments\/syllabus","course_home_url":"","row":22,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":[],"skills":[],"areas":["So"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1

This seminar surveys the changing London found in influential works of British fiction since 1945, with an emphasis on this immigrant energy, though students also consider contemporary imaginings of the iconic city of the past. Starting with the Trinidadian author Samuel Selvon\u2019s 1956 novel, The Lonely Londoners, stopping in 1970\u2019s London in Hanif Kureishi\u2019s The Buddha of Suburbia, detouring through the reimagined Tudor city of Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall (we\u2019ll visit Hampton Court), and ending with Zadie Smith\u2019s NW, students discover how class, language, and ethnicity interact with London\u2019s longer political and social past. Students discover the multicultural city in real time, as well, with visits to a variety of neighborhoods and landmarks related to the novels. Field trips are framed by short readings about observing urban life and a portfolio of classic London scenes from across two centuries of literature. In-class instruction on writing builds technical skills and inspires students to rethink how to experience the city.\u00a0","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":48,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Amy Hungerford"],"skills":["WR"],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"BRST","number":"155","section":"1","row_id":47}],"oci_ids":["30311"],"row_id":47},{"course_name_id":"78924","subject":"BRST","number":"156","section":"1","oci_id":"30310","title":"Monuments and Memory 1600-2018","long_title":"Monuments and Memory 1600-2018","description":"History is made manifest through monuments.

We go back to prehistory, look at the medieval cult of death, and bring the story up to date with the issues of memorials to women. And we consider how modern values are starting to question the monuments of yesteryear, and ask questions of how we engage with the tributes of distant generations.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":49,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Roger Bowdler"],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"BRST","number":"156","section":"1","row_id":48}],"oci_ids":["30310"],"row_id":48},{"course_name_id":"78925","subject":"BRST","number":"180","section":"1","oci_id":"30325","title":"London Theatre","long_title":"London Theatre","description":"Theatre in London is a hotbed of innovation and imagination.

Taking advantage of plays and performances in London in a variety of venues and formats, this course examines theatre and drama as aesthetic objects, social events, and cultural practices. It introduces methods for reading plays and reading performances, and investigates the various uses and functions that theatre serves within the contemporary cultural scene. As an introduction to the study of drama in performance this course presents key methodological questions and approaches for interrogating dramatic and theatrical performances, and encourages personal exploration of how theater functions and how meaning is created.\u00a0","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"https:\/\/yale.instructure.com\/courses\/38319\/assignments\/syllabus","course_home_url":"","row":50,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Paul Walsh"],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"BRST","number":"180","section":"1","row_id":49}],"oci_ids":["30325"],"row_id":49},{"course_name_id":"78926","subject":"BRST","number":"201","section":"1","oci_id":"30312","title":"Exhibiting History","long_title":"Exhibiting History","description":"This course will use the exhibition The Great Spectacle: 250 Years of the Summer Exhibition (Royal Academy of Arts, London May-August 2018), which is co-curated by Sarah Victoria Turner (this course\u2019s leader) and Mark Hallett (Director of Studies at the Paul Mellon Centre) as a springboard to explore British art over the 250-year history of the Royal Academy of Arts.

Since its flourishing in the nineteenth century and throughout the Soviet period, the Russian novel has been considered a privileged locus for the debate of social issues and political views, emerging as a critical space for the circulation of ideas in the absence of a consistently free press. In this course, we will consider five novels that took up the turbulent politics of their time, but that also became themselves actors in the political sphere. Readings will include: Dostoevsky's Demons, Bely's Petersburg, Platonov's The Foundation Pit, Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago, and Sorokin's Day of the Oprichnik. Topics of discussion: the literary representation of modernity and its pressures, especially the relation of the people to the state; the novel of ideas: conservatism, liberalism, progressivism, radicalism; the politics of publication from imperial censorship to the Cold War; literature as a form of political activism, critique, and satire; and the social and cultural legacy of the \u201cclassic\u201d Russian novel.","requirements":"Readings and discussions in English.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"https:\/\/yale.instructure.com\/courses\/37178\/assignments\/syllabus","course_home_url":"","row":200,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Molly Brunson"],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"TTh 13.00-16.15","long_summary":"TTh 13.00-16.15","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["13","16.15",""]],"Thursday":[["13","16.15",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HUMS","number":"S222","section":"1","row_id":199}],"oci_ids":["30243"],"row_id":199},{"course_name_id":"79076","subject":"HUMS","number":"S250","section":"1","oci_id":"30138","title":"Rome","long_title":"Rome","description":"","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":201,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Virginia Jewiss"],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"M-F 9.00-12.00","long_summary":"M-F 9.00-12.00","by_day":{"Monday":[["9","12",""]],"Tuesday":[["9","12",""]],"Wednesday":[["9","12",""]],"Thursday":[["9","12",""]],"Friday":[["9","12",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HUMS","number":"S250","section":"1","row_id":200}],"oci_ids":["30138"],"row_id":200},{"course_name_id":"79077","subject":"HUMS","number":"S267","section":"1","oci_id":"30139","title":"Age of Cathedrals","long_title":"Age of Cathedrals","description":"","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"https:\/\/yale.instructure.com\/courses\/37237\/assignments\/syllabus","course_home_url":"","row":202,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["R.

Why do young girls starve themselves to death pursuing unrealistic ideals of thinness? Why do people hear voices and see things that are not there? When do these problems typically start, how can we understand factors that increase the risk of experiencing psychological problems, and what options exist for treatment?

After reviewing historical perspectives, current diagnostic approaches and classification systems, the course will discuss specific disorders including mood and anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, substance-related disorders, and eating disorders.

Since its flourishing in the nineteenth century and throughout the Soviet period, the Russian novel has been considered a privileged locus for the debate of social issues and political views, emerging as a critical space for the circulation of ideas in the absence of a consistently free press. In this course, we will consider five novels that took up the turbulent politics of their time, but that also became themselves actors in the political sphere. Readings will include: Dostoevsky's Demons, Bely's Petersburg, Platonov's The Foundation Pit, Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago, and Sorokin's Day of the Oprichnik. Topics of discussion: the literary representation of modernity and its pressures, especially the relation of the people to the state; the novel of ideas: conservatism, liberalism, progressivism, radicalism; the politics of publication from imperial censorship to the Cold War; literature as a form of political activism, critique, and satire; and the social and cultural legacy of the \u201cclassic\u201d Russian novel.","requirements":"Readings and discussions in English.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"https:\/\/yale.instructure.com\/courses\/37178\/assignments\/syllabus","course_home_url":"","row":322,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Molly Brunson"],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"TTh 13.00-16.15","long_summary":"TTh 13.00-16.15","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["13","16.15",""]],"Thursday":[["13","16.15",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"RUSS","number":"S265","section":"1","row_id":321}],"oci_ids":["30228"],"row_id":321},{"course_name_id":"79198","subject":"S&DS","number":"S107","section":"1","oci_id":"30265","title":"Intro:Statistics&Data Science","long_title":"Intro:Statistics&Data Science","description":"Not Available","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":323,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["William Brinda"],"skills":["QR"],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"M-F 10.00-11.15","long_summary":"M-F 10.00-11.15","by_day":{"Monday":[["10","11.15",""]],"Tuesday":[["10","11.15",""]],"Wednesday":[["10","11.15",""]],"Thursday":[["10","11.15",""]],"Friday":[["10","11.15",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"S&DS","number":"S107","section":"1","row_id":322}],"oci_ids":["30265"],"row_id":322},{"course_name_id":"79199","subject":"SBS","number":"505","section":"1","oci_id":"30350","title":"Social and Behavioral Foundati...","long_title":"Social and Behavioral Foundations of Health","description":"This intensive seven-week summer course provides students with an introduction to social and behavioral science issues that influence patterns of health and health care delivery.

If there is an \u201cAsian American popular culture,\u201d how is it produced, consumed, negotiated, and theorized? What practices of representation and categories of power shape Asian American culture in each historical moment? In this course, we will center questions of race and gender in order to explore Asian American popular culture as a form of analysis, rather than a given category. This means we will study Asian American popular culture through the shifting histories and ideologies that give it meaning. We will consider the changing ideas of \u201cAsian American\u201d as a raced and gendered category that both represents and makes culture. This will require attention to moving ideas of race, gender, class, sexuality, and (trans)nationalism. We will use a cultural studies approach to read and compare a variety of popular genres, including film, television, music, and digital technologies.\u00a0","requirements":"n\/a","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"https:\/\/yale.instructure.com\/courses\/37278\/assignments\/syllabus","course_home_url":"","row":353,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Najwa Mayer"],"skills":[],"areas":["So"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"TTh 9.00-12.15","long_summary":"TTh 9.00-12.15","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["9","12.15",""]],"Thursday":[["9","12.15",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"WGSS","number":"S275","section":"1","row_id":352}],"oci_ids":["30267"],"row_id":352},{"course_name_id":"79229","subject":"WGSS","number":"S293","section":"1","oci_id":"30088","title":"The Olympics:Ancient to Modern","long_title":"The Olympics:Ancient to Modern","description":"","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"https:\/\/yale.instructure.com\/courses\/37126\/assignments\/syllabus","course_home_url":"","row":354,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["George Syrimis"],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"MW 9.00-12.15","long_summary":"MW 9.00-12.15","by_day":{"Monday":[["9","12.15",""]],"Wednesday":[["9","12.15",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"WGSS","number":"S293","section":"1","row_id":353}],"oci_ids":["30088"],"row_id":353},{"course_name_id":"79230","subject":"WGSS","number":"S304","section":"1","oci_id":"30235","title":"Men, Manhood, and Masculinity","long_title":"Men, Manhood, and Masculinity","description":"Cultural and historic constructions of masculinity explored through an investigation of male bodies, sexualities, and social interactions.
