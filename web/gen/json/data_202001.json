Particular attention is paid to the manner in which queer theorists such as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Lauren Berlant, Ann Cvetkovich, Heather Love, Jennifer Doyle, Jonathan Flatley, and Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz developed the concept in what has been called \u201cthe affective turn\u201d in queer and feminist aesthetics. The philosophical basis of affect theory in the writings of Spinoza, Heidegger, and Deleuze form the core of the seminar. We also look to an alternate genealogy for affect politics in the writings of Bergson and Deleuze on fabulation. We consider the psychoanalytic take on affect, in particular the object relations school of Klein and Winnicott, and we read critics who contrast affect theory with trauma theory. Marxist contributions to affect theory include readings from Virno (on humor), Hardt and Negri (on affective labor), and Ranci\u00e8re (on the distribution of the sensible). The writings of Jasbir Puar and Brian Massumi on the affective politics of contemporary war, empire, and societies of control are also considered, as are writings by Fred Moten, Saidiya Hartman, and Frank Wilderson on optimism and pessimism as moods\/modalities of black studies.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":26,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Tavia Nyong'o"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"T 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"T 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"AFAM","number":"775","section":"1","row_id":25}],"oci_ids":["29922"],"row_id":25},{"course_name_id":"92371","subject":"AFAM","number":"796","section":"1","oci_id":"29330","title":"Slave Systems in World History","long_title":"Slave Systems in World History","description":"In the English language there is only one word\u2014\u201cslave,\u201d or its verbal form, \u201cto enslave\u201d\u2014to describe the remarkable variety of conditions that range from the sale of prisoners of war to compelled domestic or agricultural service in ancient Greece and Rome; elite soldiers in early modern Africa, or in the Ottoman Empire; skilled sugar workers in the early modern Caribbean; the serfs of eighteenth-century Russia; plantation slaves of the U.S. South, or Brazil; as well as the range of forced labor that persists today as human trafficking.

We also examine advantages of the global circulation of African literary works and the pitfalls of a global readership. The class moves from an introductory unit that orients students to African and world literature to focus on close reading of primary texts informed by historical and theoretical nuances. From analyzing works responding to the colonial condition and the articulation of anticolonial sensibilities, to those narrating the African nation at independence and the postcolonial disillusionment that followed, the seminar attends to the formal and thematic implications of globalization for African literary writing.

The course begins with the earliest attempts by European empires to establish a foothold on the Pacific Ocean in California and concludes with California's global hegemony as a powerhouse in cultural production, technological development, agricultural output, and environmental policy. We pay particular attention to how California's culture of entrepreneurship has created both solutions to and new problems for advancements in global hunger, environmental sustainability, income inequality, labor, and media distribution.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":54,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Travis Ross"],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"TTh 11.35-12.25","long_summary":"TTh 11.35-12.25","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["11.35","12.25",""]],"Thursday":[["11.35","12.25",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"AMST","number":"255","section":"1","row_id":53}],"oci_ids":["20041"],"row_id":53},{"course_name_id":"92399","subject":"AMST","number":"310","section":"1","oci_id":"26903","title":"Interdisciplinary Approaches t...","long_title":"Interdisciplinary Approaches to African American Studies","description":"An interdisciplinary, thematic approach to the study of race, nation, and ethnicity in the African diaspora.

Our mid-century historical period has loose and tapering beginnings and ends. Our middlebrow archive consists of non-monumental materials, including out-of-print memoirs, pulp fiction, tourist guidebooks, and advertisements. The mid-level war that we are periodizing often blurs the distinction between wartime and peacetime. The subject produced by Cold War middlebrow culture (the Oriental) seems peripheral to the period\u2019s more iconic figures (the Communist, the Negro, and the Homosexual). In reflecting on the course\u2019s archive, period, and subject of investigation, we have occasion to contemplate our own research methodologies alongside thinkers such as Rey Chow, Saidiya Hartman, Diana Taylor, and Michel Foucault. Our readings also cover topics such as tourism, refugee migration, Chinatown, and the \u201cmodel minority.\u201d In addition to cultural ephemera, we engage more recognizable Cold War personalities, including Jade Snow Wong, James Michener, William Holden, Epeli Hau\u2018ofa, and Suzie Wong.

How do we know? When and how is personhood attributed? To what extent does place, and the hemispheric formation that is the Americas, shape personhood? Can personhood be \u201clost\u201d? Is personhood only for the living, or is it a question for the dead too? What forms of self-fashioning does personhood require, and how have these changed across space and time? How do individuals construct selves and public personas according to socially accepted standards? This course is designed to offer a broad and historically grounded understanding of key interdisciplinary debates and themes associated with understandings of personhood, its social implications, and the relationship between the embodied self and collective identities. Topics include the role of the nation state, the law, and science in defining persons; rites of passage in the life cycle of persons, particularly at the beginning and end of life; the legibility and performance of personhood and self through language, cultivation, and person-person or person-nonperson relationships; \u201cdegrees\u201d of personhood in relation to gender, race, class, and illness; incarceration and confinement and their relation to a \u201closs\u201d of personhood; and transnational, institutional, and psychoanalytic productions of the person.

Whom we consider a person, whom we label less than fully endowed, and the roles history, culture, and context play in the process are questions that inform some of the most urgent legal and political issues of our time.

Particular attention is paid to the manner in which queer theorists such as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Lauren Berlant, Ann Cvetkovich, Heather Love, Jennifer Doyle, Jonathan Flatley, and Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz developed the concept in what has been called \u201cthe affective turn\u201d in queer and feminist aesthetics. The philosophical basis of affect theory in the writings of Spinoza, Heidegger, and Deleuze form the core of the seminar. We also look to an alternate genealogy for affect politics in the writings of Bergson and Deleuze on fabulation. We consider the psychoanalytic take on affect, in particular the object relations school of Klein and Winnicott, and we read critics who contrast affect theory with trauma theory.

We ask how movement functions in the work of Dunham and these contemporary scholar-artists in terms of: the moving and\/or dancing body; movement and migration across geographic territories and imagined space; and participation in social movements. Inspired by the techniques these women have developed for re-imagining the possibilities for moving as an act of social change, we experiment with creating our own embodied artistic practices and research methods.\u00a0Students should anticipate a holistic experience that requires an openness to physical activity and choreography (accessible to all) as one of our primary tools for both analyzing the multi-media course texts, as well as constructing our own boundary crossing projects.\u00a0","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":136,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Aimee Cox"],"skills":[],"areas":["So"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"MW 10.30-12.20 + 1","long_summary":"MW 10.30-12.20","by_day":{"Monday":[["10.3","12.2",""]],"Wednesday":[["10.3","12.2",""]],"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"ANTH","number":"445","section":"1","row_id":135}],"oci_ids":["29688"],"row_id":135},{"course_name_id":"92481","subject":"ANTH","number":"451","section":"1","oci_id":"26965","title":"Intersectionality and Women\u2019s...","long_title":"Intersectionality and Women\u2019s Health","description":"The intersections of race, class, gender, and other axes of \u201cdifference\u201d and their effects on women\u2019s health, primarily in the contemporary United States.

How do we know? When and how is personhood attributed? To what extent does place, and the hemispheric formation that is the Americas, shape personhood? Can personhood be \u201clost\u201d? Is personhood only for the living, or is it a question for the dead too? What forms of self-fashioning does personhood require, and how have these changed across space and time? How do individuals construct selves and public personas according to socially accepted standards? This course is designed to offer a broad and historically grounded understanding of key interdisciplinary debates and themes associated with understandings of personhood, its social implications, and the relationship between the embodied self and collective identities. Topics include the role of the nation state, the law, and science in defining persons; rites of passage in the life cycle of persons, particularly at the beginning and end of life; the legibility and performance of personhood and self through language, cultivation, and person-person or person-nonperson relationships; \u201cdegrees\u201d of personhood in relation to gender, race, class, and illness; incarceration and confinement and their relation to a \u201closs\u201d of personhood; and transnational, institutional, and psychoanalytic productions of the person. Approaching the Americas from a hemispheric perspective, the course also aims to help students identify the methodological, ethical, and theoretical questions that come with using concepts such as person, individual, self, and subject and to assess the methodological and analytical advantages and\/or disadvantages of one term over the other for specific research projects in specific fieldwork sites. Whom we consider a person, whom we label less than fully endowed, and the roles history, culture, and context play in the process are questions that inform some of the most urgent legal and political issues of our time.

This course explores approaches to contemporary photography, from 1975 to the present, beginning with the first generation of postmodernism. Students examine the relationship that art photography has to popular culture and the blurred relationship among photography, film, fashion, advertising, and pornography. Trends and approaches to art photography, including tableaux, appropriation, abstraction, and simulation, are studied. Students also explore how contemporary photographers have worked to challenge, expand, and reinvent such traditional genres as portraiture, the nude, landscape, and still-life photography. Visiting artists, photographers, and filmmakers talk about their work in the context of the discussions at hand.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":283,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":[],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"ART","number":"828","section":"1","row_id":282}],"oci_ids":["20057"],"row_id":282},{"course_name_id":"92628","subject":"ART","number":"845","section":"1","oci_id":"20058","title":"Individual Criticism: Photogra...","long_title":"Individual Criticism: Photography","description":"Limited to graduate photography students.

The format includes background lectures with discussions, labs, and computer tutorials. The background lectures include a historical perspective on drug discovery, the current paradigm, and important considerations for future success. The second component of the course provides students with knowledge of the basic tools of clinical investigation and how new drugs are tested in humans. A series of lectures and discussions provides an overview of the objectives, research strategies, and methods of conducting patient-oriented research, with a focus on design of trials to test therapeutics.

The course teaches the common analytic techniques that can be used to analyze both longitudinal data and multilevel data with both continuous and discrete responses. One defining feature of the data is the correlation among responses over time within the same subject in longitudinal data and\/or among different observations within a same cluster in multilevel data, which has to be accommodated in order to make valid inference about the responses. Emphasis is on mixed-effects models and generalized estimating equations (GEE). Rationales on whether population-average research or subject-\/cluster-specific inference research may be more appropriate for various study designs and data types are discussed and illustrated. More advanced topics including mixture models, missing data methods, and causal inference are discussed if time allows. Analysis in presence of missing data is incorporated throughout the lectures and the labs. Emphasis is placed on applying the methods, understanding underlying assumptions, and interpreting results for analyzing real data using standard statistical software. Additional material on computational aspects and theoretic aspects of mixed models.

We focus on the central place of beauty in ancient Greek ethics, asking among other questions: What is beauty, and is it good? What does it mean to pursue beauty and how are its pursuits shaped by culture? What is the role of love in a worthwhile life? Is beauty fake or does it show what is real? A dangerous ideal or a guide to happiness? How might appearing beautiful to others affect senses of self or shame and honor? How is beauty tied to norms of gender, class, and race\u2014across different historical contexts? We read several dialogues of Plato\u2014including the\u00a0Symposium\u00a0and\u00a0Phaedrus\u2014with attention to their historical context before examining Aristotle, Stoics, and some modern legacies of and challenges to these ideas in virtue ethics, feminist aesthetics, and critical race theory. Other thinkers include Homer, Sappho, Smith, Shaftesbury, Dubois, de Beauvoir, Murdoch, Williams, and Paul Taylor. Course includes film screening and class trip to Yale Art Gallery.","requirements":"One course in Philosophy, Classics, or Humanities, or permission of Instructor.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":567,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Jonathan Fine"],"skills":["WR"],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"W 9.25-11.15","long_summary":"W 9.25-11.15","by_day":{"Wednesday":[["9.25","11.15",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"CLCV","number":"215","section":"1","row_id":566}],"oci_ids":["29380"],"row_id":566},{"course_name_id":"92912","subject":"CLCV","number":"230","section":"1","oci_id":"27857","title":"eClavdia: Women in Ancient Rome","long_title":"eClavdia: Women in Ancient Rome","description":"The contributions of Roman women to one of the greatest cities\u2014and one of the greatest empires\u2014in world history.

Greek antiquity offers an ideal context for considering the intricate ties between visual culture and religious practices, for much of what is known today as ancient Greek art and architecture was originally related to rituals; artifacts and architectural monuments such as painted pottery, sculptural reliefs, and temples served as settings for worship and ceremonial events and featured representations of activities such as libations and sacrifices. The seminar explores how works of art and architecture shaped ancient practices and theologies. While examining closely ancient artifacts and monuments, students consider the most recent theoretical frames related to the subject from various schools of thought such as the Paris school, British anthropology, and Bildwissenschaft.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":576,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Milette Gaifman"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"LORIA B50","location_times":{"LORIA B50":["W 10.30"]},"times":{"summary":"W 10.30-12.20","long_summary":"W 10.30-12.20 (LORIA B50)","by_day":{"Wednesday":[["10.3","12.2","LORIA B50"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"CLSS","number":"864","section":"1","row_id":575}],"oci_ids":["27874"],"row_id":575},{"course_name_id":"92921","subject":"CLSS","number":"882","section":"1","oci_id":"29714","title":"Graduate Works in Progress Col...","long_title":"Graduate Works in Progress Colloquium","description":"Students precirculate work-in-progress material from their prospectus or dissertation and present it to the class.

The course examines the roles of identity categories like ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and status in the Qing empire and interrogates the role of the Qing imperial system, as a particular political system, in managing different forms of identity. In addition to its core focus on the Qing, the course includes discussions of Chos\u014fn Korea and the Republic of China, to consider both the role of Qing empire in regional politics and the legacy of empire in China\u2019s later history.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":748,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["David Porter"],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"M 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"M 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Monday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"EAST","number":"402","section":"1","row_id":747}],"oci_ids":["28793"],"row_id":747},{"course_name_id":"93093","subject":"EAST","number":"406","section":"1","oci_id":"27373","title":"Nature and Culture in and of E...","long_title":"Nature and Culture in and of East Asia","description":"How is nature in East Asia shaped by distinct histories of modernization, colonialism, militarism, the Cold War, and developmentalism in the region?

Every year, several million new research papers are published, and in biomedicine alone, the number has been increasing exponentially. The rapid accumulation of scientific studies provides an opportunity to conduct meta-research, which is the field that focuses on performing research on existing research. Meta-research, which cuts across all disciplines and relies on a wide range of methodological approaches, involves studying the methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives related to research. While individual meta-analyses, which generally involve combining data from multiple studies for specific exposure-outcome relationships, fall under the umbrella of \u201cmeta-research,\u201d this course is focused on the methods used to evaluate multiple studies (or meta-analyses) across multiple topics. The overall goals of meta-research are to assess key research characteristics and to determine how to improve research practices and evidentiary standards. This course covers some meta-analytical methodology, similar to CDE 650. However, unlike a traditional \u201cmeta-analysis\u201d course, where students complete a systematic review\/meta-analysis, this course is designed to accommodate diverse student projects that deal with research methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives. Overall, the course provides students with the tools to (1) evaluate the quality, validity, and reproducibility of research; and (2) preregister, design, conduct, and publish a theoretical or empirical meta-research study, following the best open-science practices. Meta-research studies can be conducted across all scientific fields, from preclinical\/animal research to the social sciences. Key topics include the philosophy of science; scientific biases and bias assessment; designing and conducting a meta-research project; meta-analytical methodology; database searches; and open-science practices. The class consists of lectures and labs\/discussions. Students design a meta-research project in their own field. The goal is to have students work on a project that will be suitable for a thesis and\/or eventual publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":892,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Joshua Wallach"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"LEPH 102","location_times":{"LEPH 102":["T 8.30","Th 8.30"]},"times":{"summary":"TTh 8.30-9.50","long_summary":"TTh 8.30-9.50 (LEPH 102)","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["8.3","9.5","LEPH 102"]],"Thursday":[["8.3","9.5","LEPH 102"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"EHS","number":"531","section":"1","row_id":891}],"oci_ids":["29750"],"row_id":891},{"course_name_id":"93237","subject":"EHS","number":"545","section":"1","oci_id":"29751","title":"Molecular Epidemiology","long_title":"Molecular Epidemiology","description":"Many diseases are the outcome of a complex interrelationship between multiple genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors.

The course consists of lectures and practical exercises in which students gain experience designing and manipulating mathematical models of infectious diseases by hand and with the open-source programming language R. Knowledge of algebra is assumed, and familiarity with basic calculus concepts is helpful. There are no formal prerequisites, but students without any familiarity with infectious diseases are encouraged to contact the instructor before registering. This course is required of students in the Public Health Modeling Concentration.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":909,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Theodore Cohen"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"LEPH WINSL","location_times":{"LEPH WINSL":["T 13.00","Th 13.00"]},"times":{"summary":"TTh 13.00-14.20","long_summary":"TTh 13.00-14.20 (LEPH WINSL)","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["13","14.2","LEPH WINSL"]],"Thursday":[["13","14.2","LEPH WINSL"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"EMD","number":"553","section":"1","row_id":908}],"oci_ids":["29777"],"row_id":908},{"course_name_id":"93254","subject":"EMD","number":"563","section":"1","oci_id":"29778","title":"Laboratory and Field Studies i...","long_title":"Laboratory and Field Studies in Infectious Diseases","description":"The student gains hands-on training in laboratory or epidemiologic research techniques.

Our considerations include why certain texts cross the boundaries of nation and region while others remain confined within territorial bounds. We also examine advantages of the global circulation of African literary works and the pitfalls of a global readership. The class moves from an introductory unit that orients students to African and world literature to focus on close reading of primary texts informed by historical and theoretical nuances. From analyzing works responding to the colonial condition and the articulation of anticolonial sensibilities, to those narrating the African nation at independence and the postcolonial disillusionment that followed, the seminar attends to the formal and thematic implications of globalization for African literary writing.

Despite the specificity of this description, we find \u201cthe middle\u201d to be baggy, mundane, overwhelming, and often inexorable, as both an object and a method of analysis. Our mid-century historical period has loose and tapering beginnings and ends. Our middlebrow archive consists of non-monumental materials, including out-of-print memoirs, pulp fiction, tourist guidebooks, and advertisements. The mid-level war that we are periodizing often blurs the distinction between wartime and peacetime. The subject produced by Cold War middlebrow culture (the Oriental) seems peripheral to the period\u2019s more iconic figures (the Communist, the Negro, and the Homosexual). In reflecting on the course\u2019s archive, period, and subject of investigation, we have occasion to contemplate our own research methodologies alongside thinkers such as Rey Chow, Saidiya Hartman, Diana Taylor, and Michel Foucault. Our readings also cover topics such as tourism, refugee migration, Chinatown, and the \u201cmodel minority.\u201d In addition to cultural ephemera, we engage more recognizable Cold War personalities, including Jade Snow Wong, James Michener, William Holden, Epeli Hau\u2018ofa, and Suzie Wong.

Russell Atkins and Bob Kaufman helped\u00a0cast the shape of concrete poetry. Ralph Ellison and Adrienne Kennedy infused prose fiction and drama\u00a0with surrealist aesthetics.

From the arrival of Einsteinian relativity to more contemporary proofs on quantum nonlocality, the question of time in the twentieth century threatened to overturn some of our oldest assumptions about cause and effect, duration, history, presentness, and futurity. These new temporalities were as scientifically and philosophically vexing as they were rife with spiritual and aesthetic possibility\u2014a dynamic reflected in the literary and artistic forms that were central to these transformations. Our reading reflects this deeply cross-cultural and interdisciplinary trajectory, including histories of science and technology (Peter Galison, N. Katherine Hayles, David Kaiser), philosophies of time (Heidegger, Bruno Latour, Bernard Stiegler, McLuhan, Luhmann), critical theories of temporal form (Derrida, Adorno, Jameson, Pamela Lee, Kojin Karatani), a wide array of literary texts (William Burroughs, Thomas Pynchon, Ursula K. Le Guin, Tom McCarthy, and others), as well as important cinematic innovations (Jodorowsky, Godard, Kubrick). What is the \u201ctime\u201d of literature? of film?

The philosophical basis of affect theory in the writings of Spinoza, Heidegger, and Deleuze form the core of the seminar. We also look to an alternate genealogy for affect politics in the writings of Bergson and Deleuze on fabulation. We consider the psychoanalytic take on affect, in particular the object relations school of Klein and Winnicott, and we read critics who contrast affect theory with trauma theory. Marxist contributions to affect theory include readings from Virno (on humor), Hardt and Negri (on affective labor), and Ranci\u00e8re (on the distribution of the sensible). The writings of Jasbir Puar and Brian Massumi on the affective politics of contemporary war, empire, and societies of control are also considered, as are writings by Fred Moten, Saidiya Hartman, and Frank Wilderson on optimism and pessimism as moods\/modalities of black studies.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1065,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Tavia Nyong'o"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"T 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"T 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"ENGL","number":"981","section":"1","row_id":1064}],"oci_ids":["29924"],"row_id":1064},{"course_name_id":"93410","subject":"ENGL","number":"995","section":"1","oci_id":"27532","title":"Directed Reading","long_title":"Directed Reading","description":"Designed to help fill gaps in students\u2019 programs when there are corresponding gaps in the department\u2019s offerings.

Yet a basic postulate is shared across the spectrum: for better or worse, the old age of the Earth is regarded as the recent product of a secular science, consistently rejected by traditional Christianity. This\u00a0seminar challenges this long-established narrative, by uncovering the surprising boldness, complexity, and societal diffusion of pre-modern debates on the history of the Earth, and of humankind itself.

To address these challenges, major nonprofit organizations have collaboratively designed a set of decision-support tools for planning field projects and programs and for monitoring their progress, summarized in the \u201cOpen Standards for the Practice of Conservation\u201d (http:\/\/cmp-openstandards.org). Use of these tools has allowed organizations to more clearly articulate strategies, define priority actions, critically assess success, manage adaptively, and derive lessons\u2014all of which help to improve effectiveness and respond to donor interests. Students in this course explore a mutually reinforcing suite of these project tools: their underlying principles are introduced, students practice the techniques, and current case studies from field conservation are examined to explore tool utility. Students synthesize use of these design tools in a final project or program proposal focused on a single case study of their choice. The suite of decision-support tools covered includes conceptual models for project design, situational and stakeholder assessments, threats and opportunities analysis, conservation target identification (particularly landscape species selection), and monitoring frameworks. Students gain experience in design of projects and their monitoring, as well as familiarity with budgeting.

Theories of federalism, regionalism, states\u2019 rights, and localism are studied, as are the cases that provide a foundation in regulatory takings and the legitimate scope of land use regulation. The history of the delegation of planning and land use authority to local governments is traced, leading to an examination of local land use practices that relate to human settlement patterns, water resources, low-impact development, watershed protection, alternatives to Euclidean zoning,\u00a0brownfields\u00a0redevelopment, and resiliency and adaptation in response to sea-level rise and climate change. Students engage in empirical research to identify, catalog, and evaluate innovative local laws that successfully protect environmental functions and natural resources, and the manner in which towns incorporate climate change into their planning and regulations. Nearby watersheds are used as a context for the students\u2019 understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of local planning and regulation.

Social science makes two contributions to the practice of conservation and development. First, it provides ways of thinking about, researching, and working with social groupings\u2014including rural households and communities, but also development and conservation institutions, states, and NGOs. This aspect includes relations between groups at all these levels, and especially the role of politics and power in these relations. Second, social science tackles the analysis of the knowledge systems that implicitly shape conservation and development policy and impinge on practice. The emphasis throughout is on how these things shape the practice of sustainable development and conservation. Case studies used in the course have been balanced as much as possible between Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Latin America; most are rural and Third World. The course includes readings from all noneconomic social sciences. The goal is to stimulate students to apply informed and critical thinking (which means not criticizing others, but questioning our own underlying assumptions) to whatever roles they may come to play in conservation and sustainable development, in order to move toward more environmentally and socially sustainable projects and policies. The course is also designed to help students shape future research by learning to ask questions that build on, but are unanswered by, the social science theory of conservation and development.","requirements":"No prerequisites.

This course is based on three fundamental premises: (1) all individuals and communities, regardless of their social or economic conditions, have the right to a clean and healthy environment; (2) there is a connection between environmental exploitation, human exploitation, and social justice; and (3) many environmental and social injustices are rooted in larger structural issues in society that must be understood.

The beginnings of urban and park planning are considered in relation to these positions on the management of nature. Students survey the environmental movements from the 1960s onward in readings from the social sciences and humanities. The course explores the major debates in environmental ethics and the broader reach for global ethics. Writings celebrating biodiversity are examined along with the emergence of conservation biology as an example of engaged environmental scholarship.

It is also a course about environmental policy making. Policy\u00a0doesn\u2019t just happen the way it\u2019s described in grade school civics textbooks. And it isn\u2019t just\u00a0policy makers who make it. Corporate and civic interests play an influential role at all levels of\u00a0policy making. As future participants in the policy process, whether you come from a perch in government or business, as an advocate, or as a private citizen, you can jump-start your ability to\u00a0participate and respond by understanding how policy campaign advocacy impacts policy making. Though this topic is neither well documented nor regularly taught, there is a toolkit that can be\u00a0learned. Most environmental campaigners and policy makers learn about policy campaigning on the job. This course attempts to advance understanding of the policy-making process by exposing students to case examples from the environmental policy-making world of the past decade. The\u00a0course examines selected case examples of successful policy campaigns and seeks to tease out\u00a0lessons and best practice. No single environmental campaign is the same, and strategies and\u00a0tactics are always evolving, but there are key lessons about campaign practices that can be learned. Case studies we examine include campaigns enacting anti-toxic legislation in\u00a0Washington State; stopping the Keystone XL Pipeline; retiring coal-fired power plants in the United States; protecting the Great Bear Rainforest and the boreal forest in Canada; banning the use of high-sulphur fuels in the Arctic; securing an international ban on Arctic ocean fishing; catalyzing the decarbonization of supply chain emissions at Levi\u2019s; pushing Starbucks to adopt a recyclable,\u00a0compostable coffee cup; and encouraging banks and insurers to commit to Paris-aligned lending\u00a0and financing. Campaigners who played leadership roles in these efforts join us for class. We examine each case, seek a practical understanding of strategies and tactics used by each\u00a0campaign, and attempt to synthesize lessons and best practice.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1198,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Michael Northrop"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"KRN G01","location_times":{"KRN G01":["T 13.00"]},"times":{"summary":"T 13.00-15.50","long_summary":"T 13.00-15.50 (KRN G01)","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["13","15.5","KRN G01"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"F&ES","number":"860","section":"1","row_id":1197}],"oci_ids":["30012"],"row_id":1197},{"course_name_id":"93543","subject":"F&ES","number":"873","section":"1","oci_id":"30032","title":"Global Environmental History","long_title":"Global Environmental History","description":"The dynamic relationship between environmental and social forces from the Pleistocene glaciations to the Anthropocene present: Pleistocene extinctions; transitions from hunting to gathering to agriculture; Old World origins of cities, states, and civilization; adaptations and collapses of Old and New World civilizations in the face of climate disasters; the destruction and reconstruction of the New World by the Old.

Anthropologists are often assumed to focus on micro- or local-level research, and thus to have limited usefulness in the contemporary, global world of conservation and development policy. In fact, however, they have been examining global topics since at least the 1980s, and little current anthropological research is limited to the village level. More importantly, the anthropological perspective on the global economy is unique and important. This course examines the topics that make up this perspective, including using a single commodity to study the global economy, theorizing the transition to capitalism, the moral relation between economy and society, models for thinking about power in the global economy, articulations between rural households and the global economy, rural-urban relations in the global economy; the process of becoming a commodity, the commons debate, credit and debt, contracting and flexible accumulation, globalization and scale, and theorizing REDD. Readings for the course come from the subfields of environmental anthropology, economic anthropology, the anthropology of development, and the anthropology of conservation. This class is a prerequisite for F&ES 965. Though designed for master\u2019s and doctoral students, it is open to advanced undergraduates.

Approaching sustainability from a design perspective requires a fundamental conceptual shift from the current paradigms of product toward a more sustainable system, based on efficient and effective use of benign materials and energy. Through course assignments, class exercises, and a term-long team project, students are challenged with the same issues facing production and consumption systems today. The course is organized around the \u201cengineering design process\u201d from opportunity definition; criteria definition; ideation; alternatives assessment; and solution selection, implementation, and monitoring. To begin, the mega-trends driving sustainability discussions are presented and the case for new greener product systems is made. The course emphasizes quantitative and rigorous analysis of green design in addition to the tools needed to develop these designs. The foundational principles of the course can be summarized in the five I\u2019s: (1)\u00a0Innovation\u2014we can\u2019t solve problems at the same level of thinking used to create them, (2)\u00a0Inherency\u2014we can\u2019t solve problems without looking at the nature of the system that created them, (3)\u00a0Interdisciplinary\u2014we can\u2019t solve problems without looking at other aspects of the problem, (4)\u00a0Integration\u2014we can\u2019t solve problems without connecting segments at a system level, and (5)\u00a0International\u2014we can\u2019t solve problems without considering their context. The current approach to design, manufacturing, and end of life is discussed in the context of examples and case studies from various sectors, providing a basis for what and how to consider designing green products, processes, and systems.

Ideally, the ultimate goal of large-scale efforts is to improve \u201chuman dignity\u201d for all people so that they can live in and enjoy healthy, sustainable environments. But many problems confront professionals and citizens. For example, trend and condition data show species, ecosystems, and environmental systems are being overused, stressed, or degraded. This undercuts our efforts to approximate sustainability in practice anytime soon. In addition, our institutions for science, management, and policy are not presently designed to address conservation at large scales, so learning and change have been slow to nonexistent. Our overreliance on assumptions of scientific management, bureaucratic systems, neoliberalism, and traditional techno-rational experts is part of the problem.

The goal of this intensive seminar is to develop tools of close analysis of film as a significant art form by learning to identify elements of cinematic representation (mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, cinematography, editing, sound, and the basic vocabulary associated with each aspect) and to demonstrate how these constituents combine to create meaning. Through developing a deeper understanding of a particular film, we transition from specific instances to broader considerations such as aesthetic and historical context or ideological critique. The course also traces the history of the close analysis method from structural semiotics and neoformalist analysis to digital humanities. We study films ranging from Hollywood and American filmmaking (Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch) and European modernism (Robert Bresson and Jean-Luc Godard) to films that use expressive codes and cultural conventions less familiar to us (Lars von Trier and Hou Hsiao-hsien). Topics include genre, the digital image, landscape, body and face, gesture and screen performance, and cinematic atmosphere.","requirements":"Prerequisite: FILM 150.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"Cancelled","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1229,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":[],"skills":[],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"FILM","number":"320","section":"1","row_id":1228}],"oci_ids":["28802"],"row_id":1228},{"course_name_id":"93574","subject":"FILM","number":"330","section":"1","oci_id":"27574","title":"The Screenwriter's Craft","long_title":"The Screenwriter's Craft","description":"A rigorous writer's workshop.

Particular attention is paid to cinema getting its specificity in a dialogue with the arts of painting, sculpture, photography, and theater. We also pursue questions related to the historiography of silent cinema, examine early attempts to theorize the cinema as an artistic phenomenon, and look at some new directions in interdisciplinary scholarship on silent film. Topics include: film expressivity through the uses of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, camerawork, editing, and pictorial composition; set designs; \u2018location\u2019 as a cinematic concept; environment and landscape; face and body on screen; specters and cinematic uncanny; mood and atmosphere; the city in cinema. The screenings cover examples from national cinemas around the world such as Scandinavian cinema, Italian cinema, French Impressionism and avant-garde, Weimar cinema from Expressionism to New Objectivity, Russian pre-revolutionary melodrama and Soviet montage, silent cinema from Japan and China, European directors and Hollywood aesthetics of the 1920s, and Latin American silent film.","requirements":"Prerequisite: FILM 150.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1237,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Oksana Chefranova"],"skills":["WR"],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"W 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"W 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Wednesday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"FILM","number":"400","section":"1","row_id":1236}],"oci_ids":["29236"],"row_id":1236},{"course_name_id":"93582","subject":"FILM","number":"401","section":"1","oci_id":"29921","title":"Writing Screenplay Adaptations","long_title":"Writing Screenplay Adaptations","description":"A workshop on the art of screenplay adaptation.

Semiotics\u2019s foundational goal consisted in retracing how meaning emerges and circulates in connection with a variety of objects, from literary works to social rituals, from natural phenomena to artificial languages. In an attempt to revamp semiotics\u2019s main task, we begin from the opposed conceptualization of \u201csign\u201d in the Saussurean and Peircean traditions and from the opposed ideas of \u201csemiosis\u201d that they elicit. Then, moving from \u201csign\u201d to \u201ctext,\u201d we analyze the structures and the dynamics of discourses\u2014whether verbal, visual, musical, etc. A particular stress is put on the semantic and syntactic structures of narrative texts in an attempt to draw from them a model of human and nonhuman action. The third section retraces the way enunciation produces subjectivity and deixis, in order to gain a better understanding of the context-bound nature of discourses and some tools for the analysis of context itself as a semiotic entity. We end by discussing the complex strategies that allow a discourse to tackle \u201creality\u201d and \u201ctruth\u201d\u2014in the hope of dismantling the current use of naive epistemologies. Analytical tools are tested in class through close readings of a great variety of texts and situations, from Melania Trump\u2019s depictions to Genesis, from short novels to social encounters.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1257,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Francesco Casetti"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":["<a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YFIC\">YC FILM Stud: Critical Studies<\/a>"],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"FILM","number":"833","section":"1","row_id":1256}],"oci_ids":["27595"],"row_id":1256},{"course_name_id":"93602","subject":"FILM","number":"885","section":"1","oci_id":"29237","title":"Global Film and Media Concepts","long_title":"Global Film and Media Concepts","description":"This workshop course explores how film and media concepts move across time, through space, and among languages, and are transformed in the process.

The second half explores the role of nonprofits, NGOs, and multilateral institutions in the process of development. We study credit market failures and the gap filled by micro-credit institutions. We learn some strategies to evaluate the desirability and success of development projects in social marketing, poverty reduction, and microfinance. We use the tools of economics to analyze contentious international policy issues such as natural resource exploitation, the free trade of goods including environmental goods (e.g., waste and pollution), intellectual property protection, and labor rights.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1381,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Kevin Donovan"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"GLBL","number":"526","section":"1","row_id":1380}],"oci_ids":["29297"],"row_id":1380},{"course_name_id":"93726","subject":"GLBL","number":"543","section":"1","oci_id":"27707","title":"Practicum in Data Analysis Usi...","long_title":"Practicum in Data Analysis Using Stata","description":"This course provides students with practical hands-on instruction in the analysis of survey data using the statistical package Stata.

Challenging the dichotomy of reason and emotion, it examines how emotions play a critical role in foreign policy alongside power, security, politics, and interests. The first part of the course sets out the conceptual and methodological foundations. Students analyze different approaches, consider how they are expressed and communicated, and look at the dynamics of individual and collective emotions. The second part of the course focuses on the meaning of concepts such as trust, empathy, shame, and honor and applies them to historical and contemporary case studies. The course is interdisciplinary, drawing on research in international relations theory, politics, history, political psychology, and philosophy. It uses a variety of methodologies with an emphasis on qualitative and interpretative methods including discourse and semiotic analysis, and students are encouraged to use archival materials to find and demonstrate evidence of emotions in prominent cases.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1383,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":[],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"GLBL","number":"545","section":"1","row_id":1382}],"oci_ids":["30065"],"row_id":1382},{"course_name_id":"93728","subject":"GLBL","number":"562","section":"1","oci_id":"29834","title":"Cyber Operations in U.S. Natio...","long_title":"Cyber Operations in U.S. National Security Policy","description":"This seminar explores the evolution of U.S. national security policy relating to cyber operations by the United States, its allies, and its adversaries from 1986 to the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election.

After a detailed look at the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Egypt, contrasted with more hopeful developments in Tunisia, we consider the outlook for mainstream Islamists as well as Salafis and jihadis. The seminar spends a session examining the U.S. counterterrorism campaigns. It then studies the conflicts in Syria and Iraq and the impact of refugee flows in the region. Finally, the seminar examines the particular economic and climate challenges that confront the regional states. Throughout, we look at American policy responses and choices, but the greatest focus is on the agency that these countries themselves have.

After all, history is all we have to go on in providing the resources for making sense of the world we live in. Successful policy makers often understand this and turn a view of the past to their advantage in interpreting the present. They understand how any good strategy is grounded in a sound view of history. History and historical methodologies can give policy makers a keener appreciation of what is possible to do, but also of what must be avoided and what needs to be changed. History is mainly about change: relentless, often confusing processes over which individuals, communities, and even states seemingly have little say. But by studying change at key points in human history, we can prepare ourselves better for taking charge of our future, and for promoting or steering change when needed. This class looks at major shifts in history from European and Asian antiquity to the present. It looks at power in all its dimensions\u2014material, demographic, technological, ideological, military, or religious\u2014and shows how it has influenced and been influenced by major transformations in global history. Our aim is to better identify the key causes of power shifts, but also to get an impression of the fickleness of established orders in times of tectonic change. We have prepared twelve cases specifically for this class, ranging from the Peloponnesian War and the origins of Islamic empires to the invasion of Iraq and U.S.-China relations today. Through these cases we discuss the different dimensions of power and how they shift over time. We also look comparatively at how leaders have initiated, steered, or responded to power shifts. The purpose of the cases is to illuminate how people in the past have reacted to major change and how their choices may help us understand the tools and options that are at our disposal when making critical decisions.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1403,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Arne Westad"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"Th 15.30-17.20","long_summary":"Th 15.30-17.20","by_day":{"Thursday":[["15.3","17.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"GLBL","number":"803","section":"1","row_id":1402}],"oci_ids":["27716"],"row_id":1402},{"course_name_id":"93748","subject":"GLBL","number":"827","section":"1","oci_id":"27718","title":"Totalitarianism: An Intellectu...","long_title":"Totalitarianism: An Intellectual History","description":"Fall 2017 marked the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, which ushered in the largest and most all-encompassing social engineering experiment in human history.

If it is the case that, as John Locke writes quoting Cicero, salus populi suprema lex esto (the safety of the people should be the supreme law), and if, furthermore, this maxim extends in the name of national security up to and including the point where the lives of certain people and populations are thrown into question, then all instances where the state kills, sanctions killing, or benefits directly or indirectly from the killing of its own citizens must be in question in the course. It may seem strange\u2014modern politics, economics, and philosophy all begin from death sentences. The French revolution depended on bloody executions that were \u201cnecessary\u201d for founding a new polity. The Atlantic slave trade condemned millions of Africans to death, under economic reasoning, for the benefit of world capitalism. Athens killed the philosopher Socrates because he was dangerous to the polis, and philosophy has enshrined this death sentence as its mythical origin and its most modern moment. We investigate the stories and logics these events have in common.\u00a0Why does the state kill its own? Why are death sentences necessary for the current complex of state-nation-capital? Why did \u201cbarbaric\u201d practices not end with enlightenment, the critique of religion, scientific rationalism, modernization, capitalism?

We focus primarily on the case study of western Americana in order to examine how influential collectors and their collections have shaped what has been valued and devalued, preserved and lost from the textual remains of the past much more broadly.\u00a0In lieu of a traditional research paper, students complete a series of assignments over the course of the semester that add up to a virtual collection of printed materials within a thoroughly defined subject area. Students have significant freedom in choosing how to define their collecting area and are not necessarily be constrained to western materials, or even strictly to Americana.\u00a0There are several site visits to libraries and museums at Yale and around New Haven, including the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscripts Library, Yale Center for British Art, and the William Reese Company and the New York Antiquarian Book Fair just before spring break.\u00a0","requirements":"Enrollment limited to first-year students.

It explores the ways in which national identities and nation-states formed\u2014in ways both organic and forced\u2014around certain myths and ideologies. It examines the impact of these national\/nationalist myths on revolutions and uprisings in the late Ottoman and post-Ottoman Middle East. The course readings, sources, and discussions examine the relationship between myths of national origin, revolution, and state-making. The class also addresses the ways in which the control over the creation of myths of origin and ethnic, racial, national, and religious identity shaped society and politics in nation-states, republics, and monarchies especially after 1918. The course focuses partly on the theoretical underpinnings of national myth-making and ideologies of nationalism in order to offer historical understandings as to how states, majority and minority groups, and different national movements in post-Ottoman society created and re-made \u2018imagined communities\u2019 of nationals and citizens, sometimes through violence. The course surveys the ways in which new identities became manifested in a number of often-revolutionary ideologies including pan-Arab nationalism, Zionism, Kemalism, Phoenicianism, Baathist socialism, and various anti-imperial and anti-colonial movements.","requirements":"Enrollment limited to first-year students.

First, through scientific knowledge about the sea itself and its inhabitants, such as cartography, medicine, and theories about human diversity. Secondly, we study the experiences of men and women moving across shores because they chose to do so or were forced to: merchants, converts, pirates, and slaves. The contradictory essence of the Mediterranean in this period (16th-18th centuries) emerges from the interplay of constraints\u2014geographic and political boundaries, epidemics and poverty\u2014and possibilities, such as commercial and maritime practices, or malleable religious and social identities.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1505,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Barbara Di Gennaro"],"skills":["WR"],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":["<ul><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHS2\">YC HSHM: Sci, Tech &amp; Society<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHS4\">YC HSHM: Global Health<\/a><\/li><\/ul>"],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"Th 15.30-17.20","long_summary":"Th 15.30-17.20","by_day":{"Thursday":[["15.3","17.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HIST","number":"322J","section":"1","row_id":1504}],"oci_ids":["20051"],"row_id":1504},{"course_name_id":"93850","subject":"HIST","number":"325","section":"1","oci_id":"27801","title":"Introduction to Latin American...","long_title":"Introduction to Latin American History","description":"Critical themes and events in Latin American history from pre-Columbian times to the present.

Far less often do they think about Mexico\u2019s history, politics, or global presence. Most people in the United States\u2014known as estadonudienses in Mexico\u2014are woefully ignorant of these elements. This course challenges us to do better amid heightened concerns over human rights both in Mexico and at the border, ongoing debates about the so-called new NAFTA deal, and the intensification of related conflicts affecting Mexico\u2019s 124 million citizens (about 12 million of whom reside in the U.S.). We cover over 500 years of Mexican history: from the conquest and colonization of Mesoamerica (for our purposes, \u201cMexico\u201d before 1492); through the labyrinthine pathways to independence and national sovereignty during the formative yet formidable nineteenth century; to the revolutionary processes of the early twentieth century and their enduring impact on nation-state formation, popular culture, and international relations up until the historic presidential election of 2000 and the equally historic election of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO) in July 2018.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1507,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":[],"skills":["WR"],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":["<ul><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHI2\">YC History: United States<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHI3\">YC History: Latin America<\/a><\/li><\/ul>"],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"W 15.30-17.20","long_summary":"W 15.30-17.20","by_day":{"Wednesday":[["15.3","17.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HIST","number":"330J","section":"1","row_id":1506}],"oci_ids":["27802"],"row_id":1506},{"course_name_id":"93852","subject":"HIST","number":"335","section":"1","oci_id":"27803","title":"A History of South Africa","long_title":"A History of South Africa","description":"An introduction to the history of southern Africa, especially South Africa.

We take the social and psychological process of individuation, by which the world makes humans even as humans make the world\u2014being, even as we are becoming\u2014as the foundation of the primary tasks of historical thinking and writing: to analyze (to ask why and how things change) and to narrate (to explain that change). The seminar\u2019s title\u2014Necessity, Freedom, Instinct, Doubt\u2014represents the largest categories of critical thinking, the idea that humans live enmeshed in limits, needs, and coercions; that they fight to break out of those relations and establish new realms of autonomy; and that, even as they do, they are driven by forces\u2014both psychic drives and historical burdens\u2014that are barely perceptible, rarely controllable, and perhaps ultimately unknowable: a fact that has given more than one thinker pause as to what could be said on any given topic. Thus, the first guides to this methodological exploration into limits, freedom, drives, and doubt are Hegel, Marx, Freud, and Arendt. We read essays by Jean-Paul Sartre, E.P.

Through a weekly seminar (with readings, case studies, guest lectures, and seminar-style discussion), students develop the knowledge and tools to engage critically and constructively with the ideas and practices constituting advocacy, movement-building, and policy-making in global health, and work to develop a capstone project in which they explore and\/or present various forms of policy development, strategic advocacy, and\/or claims-making in global health.Course readings and approaches draw from human rights, public health, historical, anthropological, and other critical frames in order to introduce students to the multiple lenses through which questions of global health justice can be addressed.

While the challenges in health policy demand ever more complex academic study, some 100 million Americans do not know, for example, that the Affordable Care Act is the same thing as Obamacare\u2014much less what the law includes and means. The gap between those driving the conversation and those alienated and excluded from it is growing daily. This severely limits systemic improvements, and even rational discussion of improvement. Traditionally, public health experts have had a limited array of tools at their disposal to engage in public discourse, to reach people outside of their immediate circles of professional contacts, and to inform, hear from, react to, and influence the lives of many. This course is predicated on the idea that science cannot be conceived as a system by which knowledge emanates outward (much less downward) from academia, or it will cease to reach people and affect the world, only exacerbating distrust, division, and claims of elitism. Public health can only exist as an active process of communication between practitioners, researchers, and the public. Trust is built when science happens as a shared endeavor.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1576,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["James Hamblin"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"TBA TBA","location_times":{"TBA TBA":["W 16.10"]},"times":{"summary":"W 16.10-19.10","long_summary":"W 16.10-19.10 (TBA TBA)","by_day":{"Wednesday":[["16.1","19.1","TBA TBA"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HPM","number":"536","section":"1","row_id":1575}],"oci_ids":["29802"],"row_id":1575},{"course_name_id":"93921","subject":"HPM","number":"542","section":"1","oci_id":"29803","title":"Health of Women and Children","long_title":"Health of Women and Children","description":"The focus of this course is women\u2019s and children\u2019s health and health care in the United States.

In spite of these differences, the aims of health care systems worldwide are often quite similar: chiefly, to facilitate access to high-quality care that improves health at a reasonable cost. Over the course of the term we identify themes in how countries organize their health care systems, examine the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to the payment and delivery of health care, and explore specific examples of ongoing efforts to reform health systems. Recurring concepts include the role of public and private systems in financing and delivering health care, the impact of the local environment on the structure of health care systems, and the effect of health system design on patient and provider behavior.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1583,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Chimaeze Ndumele"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"LEPH 101","location_times":{"LEPH 101":["Th 15.00"]},"times":{"summary":"Th 15.00-16.50","long_summary":"Th 15.00-16.50 (LEPH 101)","by_day":{"Thursday":[["15","16.5","LEPH 101"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HPM","number":"576","section":"1","row_id":1582}],"oci_ids":["29808"],"row_id":1582},{"course_name_id":"93928","subject":"HPM","number":"583","section":"1","oci_id":"29809","title":"Methods in Health Services Res...","long_title":"Methods in Health Services Research","description":"This course introduces students to both quantitative and qualitative methods for research in health services.

The two problems addressed this year are (1) the opioid crisis; and (2) harmful health behaviors and habits, e.g., use of tobacco, overeating, and alcohol abuse. The first part of the course builds the knowledge base about these problems. In the second part, students actively participate in debates, panels, etc., and in developing and scaling (in theory) solutions. The course focuses on establishing the causes of and then solutions to these behaviors and problems. It covers facts and findings from the literature; analytic methods used in the literature to establish causality and evidence on effectiveness of alternative solutions; rational and behavioral economic models of behaviors; methods to evaluate social impact; and how to scale through government policies, social entrepreneurship, start-ups, and collaborations with foundations or businesses. Solutions are based on analyses of the problems, evidence on the effectiveness of related or parallel solutions, and efforts to innovate and perhaps even \u201cdisrupt.\u201d Students must analyze the problem and propose solutions, which could be\u2014but do not have to be\u2014pursued; that is, the proposals can be on paper only, but nonetheless there must be a plan for scaling the project or policy to have important social impacts, at least in theory.

We learn to appreciate the symbolic, stylistic, and aesthetic particulars of the artworks observed in relation to color, texture, pattern, form, composition, motion, scale, and line. Students gain an understanding of the conversations between arts and religion and the sacred in Africa. They explore how gender ideals and roles in societies are embodied in artworks. We discuss indigenous symbols of chiefly and royal power.

It has been told and experienced in a stunning range of media across time and space: from epic verse and lyric poetry to painting, film, graphic novels, and puppet theater. While Valmiki\u2019s Sanskrit Ramayana of ca. 500 BCE is acknowledged as the first, writers have recounted the tale in the polyglot array of Indic languages, from Kashmiri to Telugu, and infused it with the values and interests of their own time and place. The story\u2019s flexibility and capaciousness has encouraged social contestation and given voice to the concerns of disenfranchised social groups, including women and Dalits. This seminar examines a generous array of South Asia\u2019s visual Ramayana traditions from the ancient to the modern, encompassing temple relief sculpture, painted courtly manuscripts, and comic book and filmic Ramayanas.

At various points in his life he was celebrated as a writer, painter, designer, craftsman, socialist, preservationist, and historian. He wrote prose and essays throughout his life, but he also became an accomplished dyer, weaver, printer, and designer. In the late nineteenth century, his influence was substantial, but his stature has fragmented or even declined over the course of the twentieth. His designs for wallpaper, textiles, and books have been most enduring. Arts and crafts enthusiasts always cite him but have rarely read much of his writings or have a full command of his activities. Some scholars, such as Nikolaus Pevsner, have celebrated him as a proto-modernist, while others, such as Jackson Lears, portray him as an antimodernist. Yet familiarity with the full range of Morris\u2019s activities reveals that his influence has been considerable in the subsequent practice and theorizing of the decorative arts. It was Morris who articulated the view that craft, the act of pleasurable skilled work, could be both a form of art and a form of political activism. Taking advantage of the special exhibition on Victorian radicals at the Yale Center for British Art in spring 2020, this seminar considers the full measure of Morris, provides a sense of his context, and explores his influence in the twentieth century.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1630,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Edward Cooke"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"LORIA 360","location_times":{"LORIA 360":["W 9.25"]},"times":{"summary":"W 9.25-11.15","long_summary":"W 9.25-11.15 (LORIA 360)","by_day":{"Wednesday":[["9.25","11.15","LORIA 360"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HSAR","number":"528","section":"1","row_id":1629}],"oci_ids":["27871"],"row_id":1629},{"course_name_id":"93975","subject":"HSAR","number":"530","section":"1","oci_id":"27684","title":"Ernst Cassirer: Form as Function","long_title":"Ernst Cassirer: Form as Function","description":"Cassirer\u2019s philosophy of the \u201csymbolic form\u201d\u2014foundational for the art historical method of iconography as well as structural analysis in literature and art\u2014is reexamined for its validity.

Structured around a series of case studies, this seminar considers highlights from the history of Russian decorative arts, all while exploring broader questions about the transnational movement of style, the intersection of nationalism and design, the invention of \u201cnative\u201d cultures, and the materialities of empire and modernity. Topics include the branding of Catherine the Great; Russia\u2019s natural resources and trade networks; consumer culture in St. Petersburg; the materialism of realism; the Abramtsevo artists\u2019 colony and the discovery of folk art; russkii stil\u2019 (Russian Style) at the World\u2019s Fairs; curating ethnographies and archaeologies; and the \u201crelics\u201d of the Romanovs. Organized as an intensive research seminar, this course brings the central conceptual and theoretical concerns of visual and material culture studies (e.g., materiality and thing theory, ornament and the decorative, the socioeconomics of taste) to a historical and object-based consideration of Russian style. Significant use is made of the museum and library collections at Yale and nearby.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1634,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Molly Brunson"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"Th 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"Th 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Thursday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HSAR","number":"535","section":"1","row_id":1633}],"oci_ids":["29063"],"row_id":1633},{"course_name_id":"93979","subject":"HSAR","number":"537","section":"1","oci_id":"29893","title":"Modern Sculpture","long_title":"Modern Sculpture","description":"This course charts the history and theory of modern sculpture from the 1870s to the 1970s as it tacked between two poles, the monument and the commodity.\u00a0While our focus is European and American art, we examine how sculptures, artifacts, and objects made outside these regions expanded the terms of sculpture and challenged its claim to modernity.\u00a0Topics include intersections of sculpture and modern technologies; the display and circulation of modern sculpture; the material turn in art historical scholarship; sculptural representations of race and nation.

Greek antiquity offers an ideal context for considering the intricate ties between visual culture and religious practices, for much of what is known today as ancient Greek art and architecture was originally related to rituals; artifacts and architectural monuments such as painted pottery, sculptural reliefs, and temples served as settings for worship and ceremonial events and featured representations of activities such as libations and sacrifices. The seminar explores how works of art and architecture shaped ancient practices and theologies. While examining closely ancient artifacts and monuments, students consider the most recent theoretical frames related to the subject from various schools of thought such as the Paris school, British anthropology, and Bildwissenschaft.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1636,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Milette Gaifman"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"LORIA B50","location_times":{"LORIA B50":["W 10.30"]},"times":{"summary":"W 10.30-12.20","long_summary":"W 10.30-12.20 (LORIA B50)","by_day":{"Wednesday":[["10.3","12.2","LORIA B50"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HSAR","number":"563","section":"1","row_id":1635}],"oci_ids":["27873"],"row_id":1635},{"course_name_id":"93981","subject":"HSAR","number":"592","section":"1","oci_id":"27875","title":"Art of the Chora Monastery","long_title":"Art of the Chora Monastery","description":"The greatest monument of late Byzantine painting, the early fourteenth-century mosaics and frescoes of the Chora Monastery in Istanbul, were the subject of a massive four-volume publication during the 1970s.

It centers on photography and its historically vexed relationship to painting and the modernist discourses of medium purity, autonomy, and self-reflexivity, but it also takes up the history of those discourses as they relate to other media and as they are troubled by the hybridity of the photograph. Beginning with the philosophical origins of the distinction between literature and the visual arts, the seminar considers Clement Greenberg\u2019s polemics on painting, sculpture, and collage and his occasional forays into photographic criticism. It addresses attempts at developing an ontology of the photograph (Roland Barthes\u2019s Camera Lucida most particularly), as well as criticisms of those attempts. It also addresses revisions of the definition of photography, as well as multimedia, inter-media, post-medium, and new media discourses. Finally, it looks at declarations and predictions of the death of painting, the end of photography, and the mutation of film into a digital medium. Readings in key theoretical and critical texts set in relation to particular practices in painting, drawing, and photography; discussions, oral presentations, and final papers.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1640,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Carol Armstrong"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"LORIA 360","location_times":{"LORIA 360":["T 13.30"]},"times":{"summary":"T 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"T 13.30-15.20 (LORIA 360)","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["13.3","15.2","LORIA 360"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HSAR","number":"684","section":"1","row_id":1639}],"oci_ids":["27882"],"row_id":1639},{"course_name_id":"93985","subject":"HSAR","number":"697","section":"1","oci_id":"27883","title":"Critical Readings in Art and T...","long_title":"Critical Readings in Art and Technology: Picture Industry","description":"Borrowing the title of Walead Beshty\u2019s edited volume Picture Industry: A Provisional History of the Technical Image, this seminar charts the critical historiography of pictures and images relative to modernist and contemporary narratives of art and technology.","requirements":"Enrollment restricted and by permission of the instructor, with priority given to Ph.D. students in History of Art.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1641,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Pamela Lee"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"LORIA 360","location_times":{"LORIA 360":["T 9.25"]},"times":{"summary":"T 9.25-11.15","long_summary":"T 9.25-11.15 (LORIA 360)","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["9.25","11.15","LORIA 360"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HSAR","number":"697","section":"1","row_id":1640}],"oci_ids":["27883"],"row_id":1640},{"course_name_id":"93986","subject":"HSAR","number":"730","section":"1","oci_id":"29956","title":"Religion and the Performance o...","long_title":"Religion and the Performance of Space","description":"This interdisciplinary seminar explores categories, interpretations, and strategic articulations of space in a range of religious traditions.

First, through scientific knowledge about the sea itself and its inhabitants, such as cartography, medicine, and theories about human diversity. Secondly, we study the experiences of men and women moving across shores because they chose to do so or were forced to: merchants, converts, pirates, and slaves. The contradictory essence of the Mediterranean in this period (16th-18th centuries) emerges from the interplay of constraints\u2014geographic and political boundaries, epidemics and poverty\u2014and possibilities, such as commercial and maritime practices, or malleable religious and social identities.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1650,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Barbara Di Gennaro"],"skills":["WR"],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":["<ul><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHS2\">YC HSHM: Sci, Tech &amp; Society<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHS4\">YC HSHM: Global Health<\/a><\/li><\/ul>"],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"Th 15.30-17.20","long_summary":"Th 15.30-17.20","by_day":{"Thursday":[["15.3","17.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HSHM","number":"441","section":"1","row_id":1649}],"oci_ids":["20050"],"row_id":1649},{"course_name_id":"93995","subject":"HSHM","number":"453","section":"1","oci_id":"27894","title":"Culture and Human Evolution","long_title":"Culture and Human Evolution","description":"Examination of the origins of human modernity in the light of evolutionary and archaeological evidence.

Yet a basic postulate is shared across the spectrum: for better or worse, the old age of the Earth is regarded as the recent product of a secular science, consistently rejected by traditional Christianity. This\u00a0seminar challenges this long-established narrative, by uncovering the surprising boldness, complexity, and societal diffusion of pre-modern debates on the history of the Earth, and of humankind itself. Students have opportunity to explore the\u00a0nature, assumptions, and methods of Earth sciences before the advent of modern geology, to\u00a0question ingrained assumptions about their relation to religion and society, and to place outstanding issues into historical perspective. How have the great monotheistic religions dealt with the possibility of an ancient Earth? Was a young creation always important in traditional Christianity? If not, what led to the emergence of young Earth creationism as a force to be reckoned with?\u00a0What are the intellectual roots of American preadamism, which claims that the black and white races were created at different times and do not descend from the same ancestor?\u00a0These and other questions are addressed not only through scholarly literature in the field, but also with the analysis of literary, visual, and material sources available on campus.\u00a0","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1657,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Ivano Dal Prete"],"skills":["WR"],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":["<ul><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHS2\">YC HSHM: Sci, Tech &amp; Society<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHS5\">YC HSHM: Med Knowl &amp; Vis Cults<\/a><\/li><\/ul>"],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"Th 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"Th 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Thursday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"HSHM","number":"479","section":"1","row_id":1656}],"oci_ids":["27747"],"row_id":1656},{"course_name_id":"94002","subject":"HSHM","number":"490","section":"1","oci_id":"27751","title":"Yearlong Senior Project","long_title":"Yearlong Senior Project","description":"Preparation of a yearlong senior project under the supervision of a member of the faculty.

This course explores how ancient philosophers grappled with the challenges of beauty in a good life so that we can reflect on the ethical and political challenges of beauty today. We focus on the central place of beauty in ancient Greek ethics, asking among other questions: What is beauty, and is it good? What does it mean to pursue beauty and how are its pursuits shaped by culture? What is the role of love in a worthwhile life? Is beauty fake or does it show what is real? A dangerous ideal or a guide to happiness? How might appearing beautiful to others affect senses of self or shame and honor? How is beauty tied to norms of gender, class, and race\u2014across different historical contexts? We read several dialogues of Plato\u2014including the\u00a0Symposium\u00a0and\u00a0Phaedrus\u2014with attention to their historical context before examining Aristotle, Stoics, and some modern legacies of and challenges to these ideas in virtue ethics, feminist aesthetics, and critical race theory.

How can we make judgments of value that transcend personal or group prejudice? What makes one thing\u2014an idea or a work of art\u2014better than another? What makes some works inexhaustible sources of insight and pleasure? The main ambition of the course is to discover how great works of art from across modern culture (poetry of Wordsworth, Keats, Dickinson, Rilke and Stevens; music of Mahler, Harry Smith\u2019s Anthology of American Folk Music, Thelonious Monk and Bob Dylan; film of Terrence Malick) embody ways of valuing persons, things, and existence itself. We also read powerful theorists of ethical and aesthetic value (Hume, Kant, Schiller, Emerson, Nietzsche, Dewey, Adorno, Stanley Cavell) and distinctive critics (Hazlitt, Ruskin, Pater, Empson, James Baldwin). In developing our own methods of judgment, we ask: What criteria of value can we bring to bear upon works of art and thought? What is the relation between evaluation and fact? What counts as an insight? What does it mean to \u201cget it right\u201d in the humanities as opposed to the sciences? What is the relation between acknowledging\u2014being responsive to\u2014a text and a person?

If it is the case that, as John Locke writes quoting Cicero, salus populi suprema lex esto (the safety of the people should be the supreme law), and if, furthermore, this maxim extends in the name of national security up to and including the point where the lives of certain people and populations are thrown into question, then all instances where the state kills, sanctions killing, or benefits directly or indirectly from the killing of its own citizens must be in question in the course. It may seem strange\u2014modern politics, economics, and philosophy all begin from death sentences. The French revolution depended on bloody executions that were \u201cnecessary\u201d for founding a new polity. The Atlantic slave trade condemned millions of Africans to death, under economic reasoning, for the benefit of world capitalism. Athens killed the philosopher Socrates because he was dangerous to the polis, and philosophy has enshrined this death sentence as its mythical origin and its most modern moment. We investigate the stories and logics these events have in common.\u00a0Why does the state kill its own? Why are death sentences necessary for the current complex of state-nation-capital? Why did \u201cbarbaric\u201d practices not end with enlightenment, the critique of religion, scientific rationalism, modernization, capitalism?

Traditional lecture, worksheets, discussion, group work, and classroom activities all contribute to a dynamic learning experience. The course follows a historical narrative, starting from antiquity, to understand the foundations of mathematical thought. An axiomatic approach to geometry affords students the opportunity to construct proofs of classical theorems. The basics of graph theory are introduced in order to explore real world problems such as map coloring and bridge crossing. The ancient Greek method of exhaustion previews a discussion of the integral, and from here we explore the beautiful relationship between the geometry and topology of graphs, polyhedra, and surfaces. Throughout the course students build their mathematical and geometric intuition through problem solving and exercises in geometric imagining.","requirements":"Enrollment is limited to students who have not previously taken a course numbered at or above MATH 110.\u00a0","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":1859,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Ian Adelstein"],"skills":["QR"],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"LOM 201","location_times":{"LOM 201":["M 14.30","W 14.30"]},"times":{"summary":"MW 14.30-15.45","long_summary":"MW 14.30-15.45 (LOM 201)","by_day":{"Monday":[["14.3","15.45","LOM 201"]],"Wednesday":[["14.3","15.45","LOM 201"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MATH","number":"106","section":"1","row_id":1858}],"oci_ids":["27942"],"row_id":1858},{"course_name_id":"94204","subject":"MATH","number":"108","section":"1","oci_id":"27943","title":"Estimation and Error","long_title":"Estimation and Error","description":"A problem-based investigation of basic mathematical principles and techniques that help make sense of the world.

Behavioral finance is a large and active field that studies models in which some agents are less than fully rational. Such models have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which make it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which catalogues the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics and then consider a number of applications: asset pricing (the aggregate stock market and the cross-section of average returns); individual trading behavior; and corporate finance (security issuance, corporate investment, and mergers).","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2035,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Nicholas Barberis"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MGMT","number":"745","section":"1","row_id":2034}],"oci_ids":["28920"],"row_id":2034},{"course_name_id":"94380","subject":"MGMT","number":"746","section":"1","oci_id":"28922","title":"Financial Crises","long_title":"Financial Crises","description":"An elective doctoral course covering theoretical and empirical research on financial crises.

in the post-Ottoman Middle East, including Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, as well as in Iran and Egypt. It explores the ways in which national identities and nation-states formed\u2014in ways both organic and forced\u2014around certain myths and ideologies. It examines the impact of these national\/nationalist myths on revolutions and uprisings in the late Ottoman and post-Ottoman Middle East. The course readings, sources, and discussions examine the relationship between myths of national origin, revolution, and state-making. The class also addresses the ways in which the control over the creation of myths of origin and ethnic, racial, national, and religious identity shaped society and politics in nation-states, republics, and monarchies especially after 1918. The course focuses partly on the theoretical underpinnings of national myth-making and ideologies of nationalism in order to offer historical understandings as to how states, majority and minority groups, and different national movements in post-Ottoman society created and re-made \u2018imagined communities\u2019 of nationals and citizens, sometimes through violence. The course surveys the ways in which new identities became manifested in a number of often-revolutionary ideologies including pan-Arab nationalism, Zionism, Kemalism, Phoenicianism, Baathist socialism, and various anti-imperial and anti-colonial movements.","requirements":"Enrollment limited to first-year students.

At a time of crisis for the classical music profession, with a changing commercial landscape, a shrinking audience base, and a contraction in the number of professional orchestras, how does a young musician construct a career today? Are we looking at a dying art form or a moment of reinvigoration? In this course we develop a response to these questions, and we explore the notion that the classical musician, the artist, is an important public figure with a critical role to play in society. The course includes inquiry into a set of ideas in philosophy of aesthetics; a discussion about freedom, civil society, and ways that art can play a role in readying people for democracy; discussion on philosophy of education as it relates to the question of positive social change; and an exploration of musical and artistic initiatives that have been particularly focused on a positive social impact.

NP. Group A or B. The refined and rigorous pedagogy of the Paris Conservatoire drove a resurgence of French music in the late nineteenth century; building on this foundation, the composers of twentieth-century France cultivated distinctive and innovative idioms. They were creating music during the decades of turbulence that accompanied the rapid modernization of Western society, and were also responding to the broader artistic trajectories of the century. This course views twentieth-century France through its composers and the repertoire they created: material covered spans impressionism, Les Six, neoclassicism, Messiaen, Boulez, IRCAM, and spectralism, and reaches recent composers such as Dutilleux and Dalbavie. It also considers the contributions of non-French composers present in the country, such as Stravinsky and Prokofiev, as well as students of French composers who took distinctive compositional elements abroad.

Group A. This course explores the emergence and subsequent development of sonata form as a vehicle for creative expression in the instrumental music of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe. Through close engagement with dozens of individual movements, we will come to understand both the essential mechanics of the form itself and the dazzling variety of subtypes, adaptions, and offshoots that arose over successive generations. Zooming out, we will also consider methodological issues that attend the analysis of musical form, up to and including the vexed question of what musical forms actually are and the role they play in the creative imagination of individual artists. In the end, we shall come to understand sonata form not as a fixed \u201cblueprint\u201d or \u201cmold,\u201d but as a dynamic and constantly-evolving means of structuring musical arguments\u2014one that placed composers in a dialogue with the past while spurring some of their highest and most enduring achievements.

Group A or B This course surveys the career-spanning creative output of Gustav Mahler (1860\u20131911), balancing close analytical investigations of individual works with wide-ranging considerations of their historical, philosophical, and critical contexts. Front and center is the music itself: its bold and idiosyncratic use of harmony and orchestral color; its daring, even radical eclecticism; its spiralling contrapuntal sophistication; and above all its rich and multidimensional narrative complexity. All reward close study. But around the music swirls a constellation of long-contested issues: the relevance of Mahler\u2019s own programs and paratexts; the relation of art to lived experience; the capacity of instrumental music to tell stories or \u201cnarrate\u201d; and the symphonies\u2019 stance toward tradition at the dawn of musical modernism. So in grappling with each work, we shall also have to contend with reception traditions that are varied, complex, and at times irreconcilable. And yet each illuminates some vital aspect of a corpus that is as perplexing and self-contradictory as the man behind it, the absolute-music partisan whose symphonies were programmatic through and through.

There are weekly quizzes on the instruments and a final exam on the orchestrational techniques studied.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2309,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Chris Theofanidis"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"HEN 114","location_times":{"HEN 114":["W 16.00"]},"times":{"summary":"W 16.00-17.50","long_summary":"W 16.00-17.50 (HEN 114)","by_day":{"Wednesday":[["16","17.5","HEN 114"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MUS","number":"620","section":"1","row_id":2308}],"oci_ids":["26888"],"row_id":2308},{"course_name_id":"94654","subject":"MUS","number":"622","section":"1","oci_id":"29678","title":"Acting for Singers","long_title":"Acting for Singers","description":"1 credit per term.

NP. Group B. How are we to perform, today, music from the Baroque era (ca. 1600\u20131750)? The diverse styles of the instrumental and vocal music composed during this period elicit wide and quite differing responses from instrumentalists and singers attuned to pre-Classic and Romantic performance practices. In this course, which is centered on both performance and discussion, we take in the many possibilities available to the performer of music composed in this period. Topics include Baroque sound, ornamentation, vibrato, text-music relationships, improvisation, tempo and meter, rhythmic alteration, dynamics, pitch, tuning and temperament, and basso continuo. We compare period instruments to their modern counterparts, and we read and discuss primary and secondary source documents. Students learn how to approach modern editions critically and use primary sources to guide their performance-practice decisions. We explore detailed musical issues within larger historical and critical contexts\u2014for example, the importance of national preferences (e.g., dance in France, rhetoric in Germany). At the same time, we look at the ideologies of the early music movement as it has taken shape in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The success of this class hinges in large part on the quality of student preparation and participation. Students should be prepared to perform often on their respective instruments; they will be coached on various aspects of Baroque works from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Small oral reports throughout the term on aspects of performance practice and a larger oral presentation on a particular piece at the end of the term are required.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2313,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Arthur Haas"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"HEN 114","location_times":{"HEN 114":["M 9.25"]},"times":{"summary":"M 9.25-11.15","long_summary":"M 9.25-11.15 (HEN 114)","by_day":{"Monday":[["9.25","11.15","HEN 114"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MUS","number":"626","section":"1","row_id":2312}],"oci_ids":["26874"],"row_id":2312},{"course_name_id":"94658","subject":"MUS","number":"631","section":"1","oci_id":"29536","title":"Repertory Chorus\u2014Voice","long_title":"Repertory Chorus\u2014Voice","description":"2 credits per term.

Modern Western music notation is introduced through a study of its historical development as a tool for vocal literacy. Topics include mode, scale, rhythm, meter, and form. Lectures introduce theoretical concepts in their epistemological, cultural, and historical contexts, and small-group recitation and improvisation sessions turn these concepts into musical intuitions. Principles of modal and tonal organization are introduced by modeling repertories including Vedic chant, Torah cantillation, Byzantine psalm intonation, and Carolingian chant. Interdependencies between melodic design, musical meter, and poetic prosody are explored through immersion in a repertory of folk hymnody from the Second Great Awakening, a major site of antebellum musical contact between Americans of European and African descent. Willingness to sing is essential for this course, though talent is not a prerequisite. No experience with musical notation is required.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2452,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Ian Quinn"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MUSI","number":"100","section":"1","row_id":2451}],"oci_ids":["28086"],"row_id":2451},{"course_name_id":"94797","subject":"MUSI","number":"110","section":"1","oci_id":"28087","title":"Introduction to the Elements o...","long_title":"Introduction to the Elements of Music","description":"The fundamentals of musical language (notation, rhythm, scales, keys, melodies, and chords), including writing, analysis, singing, and dictation.","requirements":"Intended for students who have no music reading ability.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2453,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":[],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"STOECK 313","location_times":{"STOECK 313":["M 11.35","W 11.35"]},"times":{"summary":"MW 11.35-12.50","long_summary":"MW 11.35-12.50 (STOECK 313)","by_day":{"Monday":[["11.35","12.5","STOECK 313"]],"Wednesday":[["11.35","12.5","STOECK 313"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MUSI","number":"110","section":"1","row_id":2452}],"oci_ids":["28087"],"row_id":2452},{"course_name_id":"94798","subject":"MUSI","number":"110","section":"2","oci_id":"28088","title":"Introduction to the Elements o...","long_title":"Introduction to the Elements of Music","description":"The fundamentals of musical language (notation, rhythm, scales, keys, melodies, and chords), including writing, analysis, singing, and dictation.","requirements":"Intended for students who have no music reading ability.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2454,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Daniel Cox"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"STOECK 210","location_times":{"STOECK 210":["M 13.00","W 13.00"]},"times":{"summary":"MW 13.00-14.15","long_summary":"MW 13.00-14.15 (STOECK 210)","by_day":{"Monday":[["13","14.15","STOECK 210"]],"Wednesday":[["13","14.15","STOECK 210"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MUSI","number":"110","section":"2","row_id":2453}],"oci_ids":["28088"],"row_id":2453},{"course_name_id":"94799","subject":"MUSI","number":"110","section":"3","oci_id":"28089","title":"Introduction to the Elements o...","long_title":"Introduction to the Elements of Music","description":"The fundamentals of musical language (notation, rhythm, scales, keys, melodies, and chords), including writing, analysis, singing, and dictation.","requirements":"Intended for students who have no music reading ability.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2455,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Liam Hynes"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"STOECK 312","location_times":{"STOECK 312":["T 14.30","Th 14.30"]},"times":{"summary":"TTh 14.30-15.45","long_summary":"TTh 14.30-15.45 (STOECK 312)","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["14.3","15.45","STOECK 312"]],"Thursday":[["14.3","15.45","STOECK 312"]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MUSI","number":"110","section":"3","row_id":2454}],"oci_ids":["28089"],"row_id":2454},{"course_name_id":"94800","subject":"MUSI","number":"180","section":"1","oci_id":"28092","title":"History of Rock Music","long_title":"History of Rock Music","description":"A survey of major styles, genres, and artists in popular commercial music ca. 1960\u20132010.

Substantial weekly readings and a final research project are required.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2504,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Brian Kane"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"1 HTBA","long_summary":"1 HTBA","by_day":{"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MUSI","number":"938","section":"1","row_id":2503}],"oci_ids":["28889"],"row_id":2503},{"course_name_id":"94849","subject":"MUSI","number":"999","section":"1","oci_id":"28890","title":"Dissertation Colloquium","long_title":"Dissertation Colloquium","description":"","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2505,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Anna Zayaruznaya"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"STOECK 210","location_times":{"STOECK 210":["F 9.25"]},"times":{"summary":"F 9.25-11.15 + 1","long_summary":"F 9.25-11.15 (STOECK 210)","by_day":{"Friday":[["9.25","11.15","STOECK 210"]],"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"MUSI","number":"999","section":"1","row_id":2504}],"oci_ids":["28890"],"row_id":2504},{"course_name_id":"94850","subject":"NAVY","number":"100","section":"1","oci_id":"28826","title":"Naval Science Laboratory","long_title":"Naval Science Laboratory","description":"Leadership and practical application skills from the Professional Core Competency objectives that are not covered in other Naval Science courses.

Lectures weave through the narratives of these Northeast African empires, introducing students to the multi-ethnic complexities of the Sudanese and Ethiopian worlds, their history, religions, and complex geographies. Students gain an appreciation for the history of Africa, a world seldom treated in university courses, being outside the parameters of \u2018classical civilizations\u2019 of the Mediterranean, the Near East, China, and India and also beyond the southern frontiers of Pharaonic Egypt. Particular focus is also taken on the reception and legacy of Kushite and Ethiopian civilization in modernity.

Beauty has long been thought central to a good life; but beauty can be superficial, damaging, vain. This course explores how ancient philosophers grappled with the challenges of beauty in a good life so that we can reflect on the ethical and political challenges of beauty today. We focus on the central place of beauty in ancient Greek ethics, asking among other questions: What is beauty, and is it good? What does it mean to pursue beauty and how are its pursuits shaped by culture? What is the role of love in a worthwhile life? Is beauty fake or does it show what is real? A dangerous ideal or a guide to happiness? How might appearing beautiful to others affect senses of self or shame and honor? How is beauty tied to norms of gender, class, and race\u2014across different historical contexts? We read several dialogues of Plato\u2014including the\u00a0Symposium\u00a0and\u00a0Phaedrus\u2014with attention to their historical context before examining Aristotle, Stoics, and some modern legacies of and challenges to these ideas in virtue ethics, feminist aesthetics, and critical race theory.

A selection of such topics are examined through consideration of both philosophical essays written about them and legal materials that bear on them. PHIL 703 is a companion to this course. The two together comprise a literacy course in the philosophy of law. They can be taken in either order or separately.

The remainder of the class is divided into two parts: the philosophy of semantics and the philosophy of pragmatics. The first part covers the topics of reference and quantification, tense and modality, intentionality, and compositionality.

This seminar examines how causation (and the closely related notions of natural law, nature, explanation, intelligibility, and miracle) figure in the thinking of several early modern philosophers, chosen from among Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, and Shepherd. Each week we look closely at a range of primary texts, usually with the guidance of some recent secondary literature, chosen to exhibit a variety of approaches to the primary material. Although we are seeking to understand each of the philosophers on their own terms, we expect to be thinking as well about the relationships among them. Each was closely attentive to at least some who came before: Malebranche and Spinoza responded to Descartes; Leibniz to Descartes and Malebranche; Berkeley and Hume to Malebranche; and Shepherd to Berkeley and Hume. We also examine more general questions. Was there, for example, a gradual but remorseless shift from a \u201cdemanding\u201d conception of causation, according to which genuine causes should render their effects intelligible, to a more relaxed and distinctively modern conception, according to which a causal explanation need do no more than fit events into familiar patterns\u2014patterns that the mind may find utterly opaque, however familiar experience has made them? If so, was this a good thing or a bad thing: a clarifying advance or an unfortunate loss? Are there good reasons for viewing ordinary causes as mere \u201coccasions,\u201d upon which God exerts a uniquely efficacious will? Can we say that God \u201cconcurs\u201d with the operation of so-called secondary causes without suggesting that those causes have no power of their own? Do bodies and finite minds incorporate \u201cnatures\u201d that are responsible, at least in part, for what they do (or seem to do)? Or are the effects we ascribe to them the work of laws that in some way lie beyond them? What exactly are the \u201claws of nature\u201d? Are they the arbitrary decrees of the author of nature, or inescapable rational necessities? If bodies and minds differ as radically as Descartes (for example) contended, how (if at all) do they interact? Can bodies be the causes of our sensations and ideas? What is an explanation? How do scientific explanations differ from the ones that might be offered in metaphysics? Are miracles best understood as violations of the laws of nature? If so, how are they possible? The seminar begins with a brief study of Francisco Su\u00e1rez\u2019s early modern reworking of the Aristotelian or Thomistic theory of causation\u2014a theory that our philosophers thought they had surpassed.","requirements":"Prerequisite: prior study of the history of philosophy.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2605,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Kenneth Winkler","Michael Della Rocca"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"T 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"T 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Tuesday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"PHIL","number":"751","section":"1","row_id":2604}],"oci_ids":["28225"],"row_id":2604},{"course_name_id":"94950","subject":"PHIL","number":"753","section":"1","oci_id":"28226","title":"Philosophy of Conversation","long_title":"Philosophy of Conversation","description":"Conversation has its own norms: the norm that one should pay attention, the norm that one should answer questions, the norm that one should allow one\u2019s interlocutor to express objections, and many others. There is some variation across cultures, languages, and contexts, but there is also a surprisingly high level of uniformity in what these norms are. Conversational norms are social: they go well beyond the norms governing individual speech acts, and they are not derivable from general norms of rationality. Grice\u2019s Logic and Conversation attempted to account for them on the basis of the assumption that conversations are based on a shared understanding of the goal of the talk exchange and a shared desire to achieve this goal. Grice\u2019s approach has been criticized in the literature both because the assumption seems false for many actual conversations, and because even if it were true it would account only for a small subset of conversational norms. The aim of this course is to investigate whether there is a better comprehensive theory of conversational norms. Readings include work on social norms, conventions, and discourse\u2014mostly from philosophers, but also from social theorists and linguists.","requirements":"Open to all graduate students.

Indeed, images played such a significant role in ancient life that in recent years scholars have started to use visual material culture as comparanda for interpreting the texts of the Hebrew Bible, Second Temple Judaism, and New Testament. But how exactly we should think about the relationship between image and text or the visual and verbal in these periods is open to debate. In what way did visual experience impact viewers in the ancient, pervasively illiterate, societies that produced these texts? And how did that visual experience relate to the texts that were produced by the scribal culture of the literate elites? This course\u00a0attempts to answer such questions by exploring the concepts of text and image in ancient Mesopotamia, ancient Israel, and Second Temple Judaism. The course\u00a0considers ancient texts that ruminate on the nature of images, which are discussed within the context of contemporary theories of the image-text relationships in art history, classics, anthropology, and philosophy.

It\u00a0analyzes portrayals and personifications of evil from apostolic times through the sixteenth century.

In the Christian tradition, natural disasters have been critical moments in which the relationship among humans, God, and the world are negotiated, both in ritual action and theological reflection. This seminar explores natural disasters in the Christian tradition by examining ritual and theological responses to environmental catastrophe from early Christianity to the present. The questions raised by the course are: How does environmental instability affect the practice and theory of Christianity? What continuities and discontinuities can be seen in Christian responses to natural disasters across time and space? What resources can the history of disaster responses provide for contemporary religious practice? Students are expected to participate actively in class discussions and write a 10\u201312-page research paper related to the themes of the course.

Theologies of gender and sexuality have often reflected the (claimed) experiences of women and queer people in relatively uncritical ways. This course seeks rather to raise questions about how religiously engaged projects sensitive to issues of gender and sexuality should be done from a variety of unusual perspectives, pushing beyond the usual questions about revising orthodox Christian doctrine or including the perspectives of more groups into theology. Instead, the course examines specific histories and geographies of bodies, as well as debates around how bodies are written. It asks questions about the nature of representation, and the textual and visual mediation of social relationships. It examines the temporalities of feminist and queer affect in order to draw attention to the field-determining effects of the \u201cpolitical subjectivity\u201d (Robyn Wiegman) required in gender and sexuality studies. Students develop their own research projects in conversation with one of the sets of readings engaged in the course. The course is research- and reading-intensive, and allows students to complete significant research projects that may provide foundations for doctoral applications, future publications, or the like.

Have they always done so? In this course, we carefully interrogate the historical connections between religion (primarily Christianity), education, and struggles for freedom within African American communities and what I have come to describe as radical black religious education during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Students explore the ways that scholars have theorized about the radical or progressive dimensions of African American religion, as well as the different definitions and visions of social flourishing at various points throughout the twentieth century. At times, we challenge what has been included in the religious educational tradition of African Americans and what is considered radical. In part, this includes reframing dominant understandings of the contributions of great educators and intellectuals, underscoring the tension between valuing the work of black male intellectuals while recognizing the ongoing silencing and obscuring of black women\u2019s social and intellectual work. The course begins with an emphasis on early black religious educators and missionaries, like Daniel Alexander Payne and Amanda Smith, whose work in the nineteenth century set the stage for the evolution of radical religious education in the twentieth. It continues by focusing on the work of scholars such as Anna Julia Cooper, W.E.B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Nannie Helen Burroughs, and Carter G. Woodson, as well as the mid-twentieth century religiously inspired social activism and the education that undergirded much of the civil rights movement. The course concludes by investigating the corresponding changes in black churches and religious academies that resulted from articulations of black power and black freedom and by acknowledging the ongoing significance of questions regarding the interconnection of race, religion, and radical education in contemporary social change movements.

This course invites students to explore Ephesians as a vitally important resource for Christian proclamation.

The ministry of Jesus of Nazareth and the New Testament traditions that grew up around him cannot be understood apart from the witness of the Hebrew Scriptures. As resources for incarnational theology, the Hebrew Scriptures are unparalleled for their sustained attention to the suffering of believers and their articulation of ways in which ancient scribes responded to trauma through narratives, poetry, and other cultural forms that promoted resilience and renewed flourishing. This course is designed to help the Christian preacher proclaim the truth of the Gospel in ways that speak grace to those who suffer. Educators, activists, artists, and others in faith communities need to hear a Gospel that engages fruitfully with issues such as poverty and economic precarity; creaturely suffering and human responsibility; systemic injustice; spiritual resilience in the face of catastrophic injury, intractable pain, or terminal illness; the fragility and strength of the human spirit in community; benefits of spiritual practices for healing and tranquility; and artistic creativity and cultural memory as resources for addressing loss and trauma. Students engage homiletical theory, analyze sermons from expert preachers, and design and preach sermons that explore homiletical approaches to texts drawn from the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospels.

In such episodes, religion does not operate in a vacuum but draws attention to other cultural pressure points concerning, for example, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. Already in the third century in Europe, and as early as the seventeenth century in the geographic area that is now the United States, individuals and groups practiced a range of behaviors we might meaningfully, though often figuratively, label \u201ciconoclastic.\u201d This course focuses most specifically on the emergence of Christian art and architecture in dialogue with (or in competition with) Greco-Roman religions and Islam, and on variations of Protestant Christianity. At the same time, the course also directs attention to case studies within Byzantine Orthodoxy, American Judaism, Islam, and Catholicism and looks to comparative situations and episodes of contention elsewhere in the world. Topics likely considered include the conversion of \u201cpagan\u201d temples into Christian churches in late antiquity; iconoclastic interventions on Christian floor mosaics in Palestine after the Muslim conquest; destruction of images during Byzantine Iconoclasm; attitudes toward images during the Protestant Reformation; American Puritan uses of a theology of figuration to justify genocide as an \u201ciconoclastic\u201d act in the Pequot War; Shaker constructions of elaborate visionary pictures as forms of \u201cwriting\u201d rather than \u201cart\u201d; sculptor Rose Kohler\u2019s determination to define and regulate \u201cJewish art\u201d in her work with the National Council of Jewish Women; recent adjudication of the public display of the Ten Commandments or Christian nativity scenes; the Western contexts of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas; and international culture wars and the specific uses of \u201cblasphemy\u201d charges to restrict the visual practices of religions.

The first part of the course focuses on pre-Hispanic expressions of the sacred through the built environment, exploring Inca practices of place-making through the construction of shrines and religious architecture. The remainder of the course considers the persistence of Andean ontologies in the articulation of localized, syncretic forms of Catholicism. We trace the literature, architecture, and visual and material cultures of the colonial encounter, from evangelization efforts of the sixteenth century to the adoption of \u201cpopular\u201d and vernacular religious representations on the eve of Independence. The course focuses primarily on the Cuzco region of Peru due to its special status as capital of the Inca empire and cultural hub for indigenous artistic and religious expression from the colonial period into the present day. Nevertheless, we also touch on other areas of the Andean world, including modern-day Bolivia and northern Chile. We analyze a range of visual material, including textiles, paintings, architecture, sculpture, and manuscripts, to understand the intersections between religiosity and visual expression in the Andes. Readings are drawn from an array of disciplines, including art history, visual culture studies, literary studies, and anthropology.

This\u00a0seminar challenges this long-established narrative, by uncovering the surprising boldness, complexity, and societal diffusion of pre-modern debates on the history of the Earth, and of humankind itself. Students have opportunity to explore the\u00a0nature, assumptions, and methods of Earth sciences before the advent of modern geology, to\u00a0question ingrained assumptions about their relation to religion and society, and to place outstanding issues into historical perspective. How have the great monotheistic religions dealt with the possibility of an ancient Earth? Was a young creation always important in traditional Christianity? If not, what led to the emergence of young Earth creationism as a force to be reckoned with?\u00a0What are the intellectual roots of American preadamism, which claims that the black and white races were created at different times and do not descend from the same ancestor?\u00a0These and other questions are addressed not only through scholarly literature in the field, but also with the analysis of literary, visual, and material sources available on campus.\u00a0","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2920,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Ivano Dal Prete"],"skills":["WR"],"areas":["Hu"],"flags":["<ul><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHS2\">YC HSHM: Sci, Tech &amp; Society<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#\" data-action=\"search-by-attr\" data-crit-field=\"ci_attrs_YHS5\">YC HSHM: Med Knowl &amp; Vis Cults<\/a><\/li><\/ul>"],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"Th 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"Th 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Thursday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"RLST","number":"368","section":"1","row_id":2919}],"oci_ids":["27750"],"row_id":2919},{"course_name_id":"95265","subject":"RLST","number":"408","section":"1","oci_id":"29708","title":"Interpreting the Bible in Anti...","long_title":"Interpreting the Bible in Antiquity: Case Studies","description":"Examines the rich and polyphonic tradition of interpretation of two biblical narratives that were classical loci of Jewish-Christian polemic.

Part Two focuses on a series of case studies, including the rise of Constantine, North African ecclesiastical resistance, the role of bishops and councils, barbarians and Roman borders, monasticism, pilgrimage, and the cult of the saints. The course concludes with a consideration of early Christian archaeology. The course is designed for EMWAR students with a primary or secondary area of concentration in Early Christianity, Late Ancient Christianity, Christianity and Judaism in the Hellenistic East, and West Asian Religions of the Sasanian and Early Islamic Eras.

This seminar aims to provide an introduction to the \u201cbodily\u201d considerations that have preoccupied and continue to preoccupy students of late antiquity, including matters of sex, gender, and sexuality; race and ethnicity; health, illness, and death; bodily abjection, including that of slavery or asceticism; etc. In the process, connections emerge between bodily and spiritual topoi: human bodies could, for example, serve as loci of sin or salvation, or become signifiers of religious identity (for better or for worse), while the \u201cspecial\u201d bodies ascribed to angelic and demonic beings, to Jesus and the Virgin Mary, or to humanity in its paradisiacal and eschatological manifestations similarly preoccupied late ancient thinkers. The sources considered in this seminar focus on the period from roughly the second through the sixth century, and range primarily across the Latin, Greek, and Syriac-speaking realms. Most of the primary sources under consideration originate in Christian communities (broadly defined), although engagement with \u201cpagan\u201d and Jewish interlocutors features prominently in both sources and scholarship. In the same vein, this course focuses predominantly on textual matters; students interested in material culture are nevertheless very welcome and warmly encouraged to bring to bear their expertise on both conversations and final projects.","requirements":"EMWAR area of concentration designations: EarXty, LateXty, ScrInterp.

The last few weeks of the course are devoted to the evaluation of recent dissertations that both exemplify these research methods and stimulate reflection on the place of rabbinic literature in the study of religion in antiquity and in the broader humanities. This course is designed for EMWAR students with a primary or secondary area of concentration in Rabbinic Judaism, Scriptures and their Interpretation in Antiquity, Christianity and Judaism in the Hellenistic East, and West Asian Religions of the Sasanian and Early Islamic Eras. The course also provides important historical context for students concentrating in Second Temple and Hellenistic Judaism, New Testament, and Late Ancient Christianity. Note: an additional hour will be scheduled for students working with the texts in original languages. Students interested in completing a seminar-based exam in connection with the course may speak to the instructor.","requirements":"EMWAR area of concentration designations: RabJud, ScrInterp, XtyJudEast, WAR.","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2939,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Christine Hayes"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"W 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"W 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Wednesday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"RLST","number":"740","section":"1","row_id":2938}],"oci_ids":["29711"],"row_id":2938},{"course_name_id":"95284","subject":"RLST","number":"777","section":"1","oci_id":"27815","title":"Jews in Muslim Lands from the...","long_title":"Jews in Muslim Lands from the Seventh through the Sixteenth Century","description":"Introduction to Jewish culture and society in Muslim lands from the Prophet Muhammad to Suleiman the Magnificent.

Although known for borrowing liberally from western European artistic traditions, Russian imperial culture\u2014from the baroque and neoclassical courts of Elizabeth and Catherine to the exported \u201cnative\u201d imaginaries of the Ballets Russes\u2014also sought to distinguish itself in design, scale, manufacture, and style. Structured around a series of case studies, this seminar considers highlights from the history of Russian decorative arts, all while exploring broader questions about the transnational movement of style, the intersection of nationalism and design, the invention of \u201cnative\u201d cultures, and the materialities of empire and modernity. Topics include the branding of Catherine the Great; Russia\u2019s natural resources and trade networks; consumer culture in St. Petersburg; the materialism of realism; the Abramtsevo artists\u2019 colony and the discovery of folk art; russkii stil\u2019 (Russian Style) at the World\u2019s Fairs; curating ethnographies and archaeologies; and the \u201crelics\u201d of the Romanovs. Organized as an intensive research seminar, this course brings the central conceptual and theoretical concerns of visual and material culture studies (e.g., materiality and thing theory, ornament and the decorative, the socioeconomics of taste) to a historical and object-based consideration of Russian style. Significant use is made of the museum and library collections at Yale and nearby.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2969,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Molly Brunson"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"Th 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"Th 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Thursday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"RUSS","number":"655","section":"1","row_id":2968}],"oci_ids":["29062"],"row_id":2968},{"course_name_id":"95314","subject":"RUSS","number":"663","section":"1","oci_id":"28489","title":"Introduction to Russian Poetry","long_title":"Introduction to Russian Poetry","description":"This seminar presents an introduction and historical overview of the classics of Russian poetry in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including works by Pushkin, Lermontov, Tiutchev, Nekrasov, Gippius, Bely, Blok, Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Khlebnikov, Mayakovsky, Tsvetaeva, and Brodsky, as well as by several contemporary Russian poets.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":2970,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Marijeta Bozovic"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"Th 9.15-11.15","long_summary":"Th 9.15-11.15","by_day":{"Thursday":[["9.15","11.15",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"RUSS","number":"663","section":"1","row_id":2969}],"oci_ids":["28489"],"row_id":2969},{"course_name_id":"95315","subject":"RUSS","number":"695","section":"1","oci_id":"28490","title":"Russian Literature and Film in...","long_title":"Russian Literature and Film in the 1920s and 1930s","description":"This course presents a historical overview, incorporating some of the main landmarks of the 1920s and 1930s including works by Pilnyak, Bakhtin, the Formalists, Platonov, Mayakovsky, Bulgakov, Zoshchenko, Eisenstein, Protazanov, Pudovkin, the Vasilyev \u201cbrothers,\u201d and G.

We incorporate technical precision by introducing quantitative measures that allow us to study how algorithms codify, exacerbate and\/or introduce biases of their own, and study analytic methods of correcting for or eliminating these biases. Lastly, we study the social implications of these decisions, and understand the legal, political and policy decisions that could be used to govern data-driven decision making by making them transparent and auditable.

Students consider social and ecological influences on sexual and gender minority health, including migration, community, and neighborhood influences. Social institutions, including religion, school, family, and close relationships, are examined as sources of both stress and support. Given the relevance of individual and collective identity and stress as mechanisms through which stigma impacts sexual and gender minority health, the empirical platform of the course is complemented by intersectionality theory, critical postmodern work on identity fluidity and multiplicity across the life course, and minority stress conceptualizations of health.

Questionnaires and surveys are used extensively in medical, epidemiological, and public health research. The specific questionnaire utilized has great potential to affect research conclusions. Students learn to critically evaluate existing measures and how to construct questionnaires for use in health research. Topics include constructs and operational definitions, writing and evaluating questionnaire items, item scaling, domain sampling, item wording and readability, test bias, and item weighting and scoring. Students learn how to evaluate psychometric indicators (e.g., internal consistency, reliability, and validity coefficients). Students are required to construct a questionnaire and are guided through all phases of questionnaire development, including item generation, scaling decisions, survey design, pilot testing, data collection, reliability analysis, and calculation of validity coefficients. The practical learning goal is to generate a publication-level questionnaire to evaluate a unique exposure history or health-related construct.

Students consider social and ecological influences on sexual and gender minority health, including migration, community, and neighborhood influences. Social institutions, including religion, school, family, and close relationships, are examined as sources of both stress and support. Given the relevance of individual and collective identity and stress as mechanisms through which stigma impacts sexual and gender minority health, the empirical platform of the course is complemented by intersectionality theory, critical postmodern work on identity fluidity and multiplicity across the life course, and minority stress conceptualizations of health. Students apply lessons learned in the course to evaluating and developing policy and health care interventions for this increasingly visible segment of the global population.

A \u201cstructure\u201d emerges as a persistent pattern of interaction that can influence a multitude of behaviors, such as getting a job, income attainment, political decision-making, social revolutions, organizational merges, global finance and trade markets, delinquent youth behaviors, the spread of infectious diseases, and so on.

Generally speaking, these proposals call for a shift away from the monolingual, nation-based canons of \u201cSpanish\u201d and \u201cPortuguese\u201d literature and toward a comparative approach that places Spanish and Portuguese literatures in dialogue with each other and with Catalan, Galician, Basque, and other peninsular traditions. While this development responds in part to contemporary trends in literary studies and to cultural and political realities in the Iberian Peninsula today, it also draws on the historical precedent of Iberianism, a movement that involved a number of Iberian intellectuals and artists in the last half of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth. In this course we analyze primary works from this historical period alongside some of the most recent interventions in the Iberian Studies debate. Primary readings include works by Antero de Quental, Oliveira Martins, Rosal\u00eda de Castro, Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n, Miguel de Unamuno, Joan Maragall, Enric Prat de la Riba, and Miguel Torga, among others. Secondary texts include work by Joan Ramon Resina, C\u00e9sar Dom\u00ednguez, Joseba Gabilondo, Kirsty Hooper, Mario Santana, Robert Patrick Newcomb, Roberta Johnson, and Silvia Berm\u00fadez. Texts are provided in the original language, and in translation when appropriate. Seminar discussion takes place in Spanish or Portuguese, depending on the linguistic abilities of each student.

What is creativity? Is it innate? Is it a skill that can be developed? How? What happens when two or more people are involved in that pursuit of creation? Which techniques are common across disciplines? And how might a theater artist learn about creative pursuits from artists in other disciplines including music, design, and fiction as well as theater? Students from all backgrounds and interests will delve into techniques, identifying and integrating\u00a0habits that foster creativity, creating their own works over the semester, both in small and larger groups, in solo and group projects.","requirements":"Enrollment limited to first year students.

What are the steps involved along the way? What are the techniques within each phase that playwrights, directors, and actors utilize towards developing a play? This course seeks to show potential theater studies majors the practical aspects of new play development beyond the role of actor. Students are introduced to voices and stories that have recently emerged, treating the script more as a fluid blueprint rather than an unchangeable text. Students analyze and compare various versions of a playscript through reading, staging, and discussion. Each student explores texts through the eyes of directors, playwrights, actors, designers, and dramaturgs\u2014and at times adopts those roles within exercises. The course highlights the last fifteen years in American theater which has seen an unprecedented explosion of new plays, playwrights, and new play development incubators. Works by playwrights Will Eno, Annie Baker, Jackie Sibblies Drury, Sarah Delappe, and Sam Hunter are investigated, analyzed, and explored.","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":3093,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Hal Brooks"],"skills":[],"areas":[],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"M 13.30-15.20","long_summary":"M 13.30-15.20","by_day":{"Monday":[["13.3","15.2",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"THST","number":"213","section":"1","row_id":3092}],"oci_ids":["29008"],"row_id":3092},{"course_name_id":"95438","subject":"THST","number":"226","section":"1","oci_id":"28105","title":"Musical Theater Performance II","long_title":"Musical Theater Performance II","description":"The collaborative process and its effect on musical theater performance.

These boundary erasing, rule breaking women challenge us to think expansively and act courageously in our efforts to not only dream a new world but bring that world into fruition.\u00a0The life and work of anthropologist\/dancer\/choreographer\/activist Katherine Dunham (1909\u20132006) provides the framework through which we think through the strategies contemporary scholar-artists employ in their social justice practices, while the concept of movement is our theoretical and methodological foundation for engaging with the work of historical and contemporary Black women change agents. We ask how movement functions in the work of Dunham and these contemporary scholar-artists in terms of: the moving and\/or dancing body; movement and migration across geographic territories and imagined space; and participation in social movements. Inspired by the techniques these women have developed for re-imagining the possibilities for moving as an act of social change, we experiment with creating our own embodied artistic practices and research methods.\u00a0Students should anticipate a holistic experience that requires an openness to physical activity and choreography (accessible to all) as one of our primary tools for both analyzing the multi-media course texts, as well as constructing our own boundary crossing projects.\u00a0","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":3112,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Aimee Cox"],"skills":[],"areas":["So"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"MW 10.30-12.20 + 1","long_summary":"MW 10.30-12.20","by_day":{"Monday":[["10.3","12.2",""]],"Wednesday":[["10.3","12.2",""]],"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"THST","number":"450","section":"1","row_id":3111}],"oci_ids":["29689"],"row_id":3111},{"course_name_id":"95457","subject":"THST","number":"453","section":"1","oci_id":"29280","title":"Writing Screenplay Adaptations","long_title":"Writing Screenplay Adaptations","description":"A workshop on the art of screenplay adaptation.

We ask how movement functions in the work of Dunham and these contemporary scholar-artists in terms of: the moving and\/or dancing body; movement and migration across geographic territories and imagined space; and participation in social movements. Inspired by the techniques these women have developed for re-imagining the possibilities for moving as an act of social change, we experiment with creating our own embodied artistic practices and research methods.\u00a0Students should anticipate a holistic experience that requires an openness to physical activity and choreography (accessible to all) as one of our primary tools for both analyzing the multi-media course texts, as well as constructing our own boundary crossing projects.\u00a0","requirements":"","exam_group":0,"extra_info":"","syllabus_url":"","course_home_url":"","row":3154,"exam_timestamp":0,"professors":["Aimee Cox"],"skills":[],"areas":["So"],"flags":[],"average":{"same_both":null,"same_class":null,"same_professors":null},"num_students":null,"evaluations":{"same_both":[],"same_class":[],"same_professors":[]},"locations_summary":"","location_times":[],"times":{"summary":"MW 10.30-12.20 + 1","long_summary":"MW 10.30-12.20","by_day":{"Monday":[["10.3","12.2",""]],"Wednesday":[["10.3","12.2",""]],"HTBA":[["1","1",""]]}},"codes":[{"subject":"WGSS","number":"442","section":"1","row_id":3153}],"oci_ids":["29690"],"row_id":3153},{"course_name_id":"95499","subject":"WGSS","number":"471","section":"1","oci_id":"20012","title":"Independent Directed Study","long_title":"Independent Directed Study","description":"For students who wish to explore an aspect of women's, gender, and sexuality studies not covered by existing courses.

Students consider social and ecological influences on sexual and gender minority health, including migration, community, and neighborhood influences. Social institutions, including religion, school, family, and close relationships, are examined as sources of both stress and support. Given the relevance of individual and collective identity and stress as mechanisms through which stigma impacts sexual and gender minority health, the empirical platform of the course is complemented by intersectionality theory, critical postmodern work on identity fluidity and multiplicity across the life course, and minority stress conceptualizations of health.

Is personhood only for the living, or is it a question for the dead too? What forms of self-fashioning does personhood require, and how have these changed across space and time? How do individuals construct selves and public personas according to socially accepted standards? This course is designed to offer a broad and historically grounded understanding of key interdisciplinary debates and themes associated with understandings of personhood, its social implications, and the relationship between the embodied self and collective identities. Topics include the role of the nation state, the law, and science in defining persons; rites of passage in the life cycle of persons, particularly at the beginning and end of life; the legibility and performance of personhood and self through language, cultivation, and person-person or person-nonperson relationships; \u201cdegrees\u201d of personhood in relation to gender, race, class, and illness; incarceration and confinement and their relation to a \u201closs\u201d of personhood; and transnational, institutional, and psychoanalytic productions of the person.

Whom we consider a person, whom we label less than fully endowed, and the roles history, culture, and context play in the process are questions that inform some of the most urgent legal and political issues of our time.
